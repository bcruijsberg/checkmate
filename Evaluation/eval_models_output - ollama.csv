# Russia abandons International Space Station: It could fall on Europe!

They say the partnership will only be restored when sanctions are lifted

![Russia abandons International Space Station: It could fall on Europe!](https://phantom.estaticos-marca.com/149e4bc43e9009d5e618c337ffb98dee/resize/1320/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2022/04/03/16490008307804.png)

**Russia** has ended its cooperation with **Western countries** regarding the **International Space Station**, with the country's space director stating on Saturday that the ties would only be restored in the event that the sanctions imposed by the **West** on **Moscow** are lifted.

**Dmitry Rogozin**, the head of **Roscosmos**, said in a social media post that the aim of the sanctions was ""to kill the Russian economy and plunge our people into despair and hunger, to bring our country to its knees."" He added that ""they will not succeed, but the intentions are clear.""

""That is why I believe that the restoration of normal relations between the partners of the **International Space Station (ISS)** and other projects is only possible with the full and unconditional removal of the illegal sanctions imposed,"" **Rogozin** said.

## International Space Station could plunge towards Earth

The **West** has introduced wide-ranging sanctions against **Russia** for what **Moscow** calls a ""special military operation"" in **Ukraine**, which was launched on February 24. Despite the tensions, a [**US astronaut**](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/03/15/622fc081e2704e25918b458d.html) and two **Russian cosmonauts** landed safely in Kazakhstan last Wednesday after leaving the space station aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule.

The end of cooperation will mean, **Rogozin** said, a serious risk of an uncontrolled departure of the station from its orbit and a possible fall onto the territory of the **United States**, **Europe** or other countries.

""There is a possibility that this 500-tonne structure could fall over **Europe** and also over **India** and **China**. The **ISS** does not fly over **Russia**, so all the risks are theirs. Are they prepared for that?"" the **Roscosmos** chief warned.

# Anti-Semitism: New Danger from Old Myths

Status: 14.02.2022 15:21

**A global conspiracy is said to be Corona, with the goal of a totalitarian dictatorship or even genocide: Such conspiracy legends are a new packaging for old anti-Semitic myths.**

By [Patrick Gensing](/correspondents/patrick-gensing-101.html), ARD-aktuell

*By Patrick Gensing, ARD-faktenfinder editorial team*

Conspiracy myths and downplaying of National Socialism have become more publicly visible in Germany during the Corona pandemic. Just last week, a speaker at the Brandenburg Gate, near the Holocaust Memorial, compared himself to Jews in the 1930s.

About two weeks earlier, activists in Berlin had shown posters with ""Total Hygiene"" and ""Total Vaccination"" written in Fraktur script, reminiscent of swastika flags, apparently trying to equate the measures against the pandemic with the terror of the National Socialist dictatorship.

The posters had also been shown at ""lateral thinker"" protests in early October. At that time, activists also showed a logo for a ""democratic resistance"". The motif of the ""People's Constitutional Convention"" contains the red triangle of the political prisoners of the National Socialist concentration camps.

## ""Outrageous""

These are just a few examples from recent months. But what is anti-Semitic about such statements and representations?

On the one hand, they downplay the crimes of the National Socialist dictatorship. When people hold speeches at registered demonstrations and spread them on the internet, exercising their fundamental right to freedom of assembly and expression, a comparison with the totalitarian National Socialist regime is completely inappropriate - and often unbearable for people who were actually exposed to this political terror.

Maram Stern, Vice President of the World Jewish Congress, called it ""particularly repulsive"" when so-called Corona deniers tried to claim a victim role for themselves that is equivalent to that of the Holocaust victims. ""I don't know what could be more outrageous than seizing the history of suffering of the elderly survivors of Auschwitz, Majdanek, and thousands of other concentration camps and ghettos. It is the epitome of lack of empathy, blindness, and cynicism.""

### NS Comparisons Relativize and Demonize

NS comparisons keep appearing - and have a dual function. more](/faktenfinder/ns-comparisons-antisemitism-101.html)

## ""Attempts to Downplay History""

Because if one follows the claims of the activists who equate today's situation with that during the National Socialist dictatorship, one could come to the conclusion that the persecution of Jews and the Holocaust could not have been worse than the current measures to combat the coronavirus.

Experts therefore speak of a relativization and downplaying of National Socialist crimes. Samuel Salzborn, the anti-Semitism commissioner of the state of Berlin, told the *ARD-faktenfinder* that such NS comparisons serve ""a dual function"". With regard to the National Socialist past, it is ""a revisionist relativization of the Shoah, in which the anti-Semitic policy of destruction is infamously instrumentalized"". With regard to the present, ""the conspiracy believers fantasize themselves into a victim role that is supposed to demonize and delegitimize democratic politics"".

# 63% of Transactions in Bulgaria are made in Cash

![](//www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_big_214573.jpg)

Bulgaria is second in Europe after Romania in the number of cash payments, according to statistics from ‘Global Findex’. In our country, 63% of transactions are made with cash, and in our neighbor - over 78%. Although the pandemic was expected to increase the digitalization of money and minimize physical cash and its applicability, data show that consumers in Europe still prefer cash payments.

**European countries in which cash transactions are predominant are:**

1. Romania

2. Bulgaria

3. The Czech Republic

4. Ukraine

5. Hungary

6. Slovakia

7. Greece

With over 70% and 63% of the total number of cash transactions, Romania and Bulgaria are the countries with the highest need for physical money in Europe. Also, 42% of the population of Romania and 28% of the population of Bulgaria do not have a bank account - this is indicative of the dependence of local consumers on physical banknotes and coins.

Other European countries are on the other financial pole, such as Norway, where only 3% of transactions are made in cash. Also, this country has an impressively low number of ATMs - only 32 per 100,000 population, but still 100% of adults in the country have a bank account.

*“In Bulgaria, and in Europe, there is a strong attachment of consumers to money and cash payments. Our expectations are that cash will survive the digital revolution and that people will continue to use it for many years to come as their preferred payment method,”* said Kalina Stoykin, Regional Manager of Euronet in Bulgaria, one of the largest payment companies in the world.

Euronet recently launched a large-scale campaign in Bulgaria, aimed at creating quick and easy access to cash in remote areas in Bulgaria. The ATM for the Community initiative is designed specifically for municipalities that want to offer cash withdrawals to their residents. More information about the project can be found [**here**](https://www.euronetatms.bg/%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d0%b1%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8/%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%bc-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%89%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d1%82%d0%b0/).

**Why are cash payments preferred?**

1. Cash payment is satisfactory

A [**study**](https://cashessentials.org/coffee-tastes-better-when-paid-with-cash/) conducted by Prof. Avni M. Shah shows that paying in cash is a way to add positive emotion to transactions, which promotes cost satisfaction.

2. Cash makes us sensible buyers

Using cash helps to avoid impulsive purchases. A study of consumer psychology conducted among thousands of households shows that people who pay in cash spend less and have a larger share of health products in their basket.

3. Cash brings security

ATMs are a technique and as such can break down or run out of cash. At such times, the availability of physical cash will ensure trouble-free shopping.

4. Cache helps with budgeting

Paying in cash helps to avoid overspending while shopping. Carrying a certain amount acts as a brake for consumers to spend extra when their wallet is empty.

# China's graphite dominance threatens electric car market

A rise in demand for electric cars is boosting demand for graphite, a key battery component. As battery and car makers try to secure supplies, China's domination of the graphite market has become a problem.

![A worker covered in graphite dust at a warehouse where graphite is processed]( ""A worker covered in graphite dust at a warehouse where graphite is processed"")

Ripples of last year's power crunch in China are still being felt by global battery and electric-car makers.

A shortage of coal supplies caused by an Indonesian export ban, a trade war with major supplier Australia and a steep rise in post-COVID-19 domestic demand prompted local Chinese authorities to ration power to energy-intensive industries, including graphite.

The rolling power blackouts as well as the suspension of graphite production in winter further squeezed global graphite supply, already struggling to keep up with strong demand for lithium-ion batteries as [global electric vehicle sales went through the roof.](/en/tesla-posts-sales-of-almost-1-million-cars-in-2021/a-60313972)

As a result, the mineral, which has often been overlooked when it comes to battery materials, has added to the troubles of battery and car manufacturers, who have been scouring the planet to secure supplies of other battery constituents like lithium, nickel and cobalt.

The supply squeeze, which has driven up graphite prices, has yet again turned the focus on the global overreliance on China for graphite, the biggest component in lithium-ion batteries by volume with few viable alternatives.

![Electric car getting charged]()

China dominates the global graphite market, producing almost all of the graphite that's used for anode, the negative end of a lithium-ion battery.

""We hardly have any supply in Europe to even scratch the surface of future graphite demand for the lithium-ion battery industry so far,"" Burkhard Straube, the head of the graphite solutions unit at SGL Carbon, told DW.

""Without the further development of a European battery value chain including raw materials and components I would be highly concerned how companies in Europe as well as in North America would satisfy the demand for instance for graphite in the future,"" he told DW.

## Graphite shortfall

Graphite is a crystalline form of carbon. It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity and is chemically inert with high thermal resistance and lubricity. These properties make the mineral almost irreplaceable in a vast array of industries ranging from semiconductors to nuclear reactors. It is an abundant mineral around the world but is also produced synthetically.

The demand for graphite has received a major boost from the auto industry that is undergoing a transition to electric vehicles (EV), powered by lithium-ion batteries, for now.

Tens of millions of EVs are expected to hit the roads in the next decade as part of global net-zero carbon pledges, driving a fivefold increase in demand for anodes by 2030, according to BloombergNEF. Graphite producers are unlikely to meet the massive demand at the current rate of production.

The world could witness a deficit of 85,000 tons of the mineral this year alone with electric vehicle sales expected to touch 10 million units, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence analyst George Miller told DW.

""Graphite is often a very underrepresented critical mineral in the lithium-ion battery,"" Miller said. ""Especially, not enough attention is paid to the potential for supply deficit and to the potential for the graphite market itself to become structurally affected by demand from electric vehicles.""

Graphite flake prices in China stood at $760 per ton in early February, up by 11.8% from January and up by 38.2% from a year ago, according to Rystad Energy's monthly price index.

The deficit is likely to keep graphite prices elevated for a while, further boosting battery costs which are already under pressure from high lithium prices.",2022.0,POTENTIALLY CHECKABLE,"The statement makes a factual assertion about China's current role in the global graphite market and its impact on electric car production, which can be verified using market data and industry reports.","- claim_source: Deutsche Welle (DW)

# Croatian president makes controversial statements on Srebrenica genocide

#### ‘Not every victim is the same,’ says President Zoran Milanovic

Mustafa Talha Öztürk  | 09.12.2021 - Update : 09.12.2021

###### Belgrade

**BELGRADE, Serbia**

Croatia's president said the genocides in Srebrenica and Jasenovac are not the same because Jews and Serbs were systematically killed for several years in the Ustase-run concentration camp in Jasenovac, Croatia during World War II.

Zoran Milanovic said that worse events took place in history, and a new name other than “genocide” should be found for the Srebrenica events.

""Srebrenica is not the same as the Holocaust, it is not the same as Jasenovac,'' Milanovic said, speaking to the press in the city of Komija on the Croatian island of Vis.

""I say yes, but then for some more serious crimes, we have to invent another name. I respect other people's sacrifices, but not everything is the same. If everything is genocide, we will have to find another name for what the Nazis and the German machinery did to the Jews in the Second World War. It is the Holocaust, but it is also genocide. Not every victim is the same, it is relativization,'' he said, answering a question on whether he considered Srebrenica a genocide.

The social democrat took the presidency in Croatia with the election in 2020.

The chairman of the Bosniak Ethnic Minority Council in Croatia, Armin Hodzic, said at a press conference that Milanovic has crossed the line of civilization that no one should cross with his statements about the Srebrenica genocide.

""Milanovic has an innate prejudice against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bosnians,” said Hodzic.

Established in 1941, the Jasenovac camp saw an estimated 100,000 Serbs, Jews, Roma and others murdered by the Ustase regime of Croatian fascist leader Ante Pavelic.

During World War II, the Nazis carried out a genocide against the Jews. Most of the Jews in the countries occupied by Nazi Germany were sent to concentration camps. About 6 million Jews died on trains and in the camps.

# How much do school teachers earn in Germany?

[Ksenia Safronova](/ru/ксения-сафронова/person-19567445)

September 1, 2021

DW tells you how much German teachers earn, how they work, and how to become a teacher in Germany.

In Germany, if people give flowers or small gifts to school teachers, it's not at the beginning of the school year, but at the end. In general, giving gifts to teachers is not common practice. And if someone wants to do so, they should be careful. The fact is that school teachers are considered public servants (Öffentlicher Dienst) and are not allowed to accept expensive gifts, even on holidays. The federal states decide on the maximum value of gifts. In Berlin, for example, joint gifts from students worth more than 30 euros are not prohibited, but gifts worth more than that require reporting to the school administration.

Teachers should refuse gifts worth more than 50 euros, as they require approval from the city's education department. There is also a list of [prohibited gifts](/ru/zapretnye-podarki-v-nemeckih-skolah/a-19518087): air tickets, gift certificates, travel discounts.

## How to become a teacher in Germany

In Germany, teachers are trained for primary and secondary schools, as well as for high schools (Gymnasium). Those who want to teach in high schools attend a university, not a university of applied sciences (Fachhochschule). There, they study scientific teaching methods and thoroughly explore their subjects.

In Germany, a teacher teaches two subjects in school. Combinations can vary: geography and art, mathematics and literature. During their studies, future teachers take two state exams - Erstes Staatsexamen and Zweites Staatsexamen. Between them, they must complete a school internship (Referendariat) that lasts about a year and a half. Those who come from other countries with a teaching degree will have to validate their diploma and take additional courses to teach another subject.

## How much do teachers earn in Germany

A teacher's salary in Germany depends on the federal state, the presence of a civil servant status (Beamter), and the type of school where they work. For example, a high school teacher earns more than a primary school teacher. In any case, teachers earn a salary above the national average.

According to the Gehalt.de portal, with a 40-hour workweek, this is approximately 3,000 to 5,000 euros per month gross. In addition to a good salary, the status of a civil servant provides many benefits and a higher pension. Teachers who are not German citizens cannot become civil servants.

## Shortage of primary school teachers

The profession of a teacher in Germany is definitely [promising](/ru/где-хотят-работать-молодые-немцы/a-19510358). According to statistics, due to the baby boom in German families and the influx of migrants, several hundred new primary schools will have to be opened in the coming years. Meanwhile, according to the German Teachers' Union (Deutsche Lehrerverband), the country is already lacking tens of thousands of specialists. This problem is being addressed at the regional level in various ways - for example, by combining classes.

In German schools, there are significantly more female teachers than male teachers. If we take the statistics for 2019-2020, the share of women among teachers in German primary schools was 89.39%, and in high schools - 60.46%.

# Energy Transition: Is the ""Dark Doldrums"" a Threat This Winter?

Status: 07.03.2021 08:39

**Germany is gradually phasing out nuclear and coal power. But what happens when the country is only supplied with renewable energy: What if neither the sun shines nor the wind blows?**

By André Kartschall and Andreas Rausch, rbb

When it gets cold and dark in winter, Germans consume more electricity than usual: heating systems, lights, and TVs are used more when people stay indoors. So far, so normal. But this could become a problem, warns Professor Harald Schwarz from the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus.

Because when it's dark, no solar power is produced: ""Then photovoltaic production is de facto zero, even though we have installed solar panels with 50 gigawatts of capacity in Germany."" If there is no breeze at the same time, wind power also largely fails. ""We're talking about 2 to 5 gigawatts of actual power, even though plants with 60 gigawatts of capacity are installed,"" Schwarz specifies. What arises is the so-called ""cold dark doldrums"".

## Will the ""Day X"" Become a Serious Problem?

The horror scenario is an extreme situation that theoretically only occurs on a few days a year. But these ""Days X"" could decide in the future whether the energy transition with the nuclear and coal phase-out will succeed. Because until now, Germany could always rely on its conventional power plants in an emergency - especially those powered by coal and nuclear energy.

But precisely these power plants are being shut down one after the other in the coming years. According to Schwarz, Germany is threatened with a classic ""power gap"" - even if only on a few days. ""Already in 2023, we will be missing 15 to 20 gigawatts of secure capacity,"" says Schwarz - and that will become a problem on a ""Day X"".

In the following years, the problem will worsen - because the nuclear phase-out is immediately followed by the gradual phase-out of coal-fired power generation. And power storage facilities are not yet able to solve the problem. ""Today, we have capacities that can supply Germany for 30 to 60 minutes, but not for a prolonged dark doldrums,"" warns Schwarz. That means: power generation and power consumption must be identical every minute.

## The Federal Network Agency Calculates Differently

Until three years ago, Germany had the rule: the ""secured generating capacity"" must always be able to cover the maximum power demand. In other words: it must always be clear that there is enough power available, even in extreme cases. That's no longer the case. The Federal Network Agency, responsible for supply security, calls this calculation method outdated.

Instead, they now calculate the probability of such a case occurring. The result of the ""stress test"": on average, the complete power supply is not secured for only about 40 minutes a year. But even then, the lights in Germany won't simply go out: ""In this time, the majority of the load can be covered, only a very small part may not be served by the market,"" emphasizes the Federal Network Agency.

## Agency Relies on Multiple Emergency Mechanisms

The ""very small part"" refers to a few large industrial plants that would be temporarily disconnected from the grid - such as aluminum smelters. Such arrangements are contractually agreed upon with these major consumers. Additionally, there are backup power plants that would be started up: ""For such cases, we have emergency mechanisms in place,"" says the Federal Network Agency.",2022.0,POTENTIALLY CHECKABLE,"The statement asserts a specific quantitative shortfall in Germany's secured power output for 2023, which is a factual claim about a past condition and can be verified using energy production and capacity data.","- claim_source: Prof. Harald Schwarz (Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus)

# ""Omicron"" strain detected in 77 countries worldwide

Moscow. December 14. INTERFAX.RU - The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reported that cases of infection with the ""Omicron"" strain have been detected in 77 countries.

[World](/world/)[First person infected with ""Omicron"" strain dies in the UKRead more](/world/809073)

""Omicron may have already entered most countries where it has not yet been detected,"" Ghebreyesus said at a briefing on Tuesday.

He added that despite the fact that there are few severe cases of ""Omicron"" infection, the number of cases is growing rapidly, which may lead to overcrowding in hospitals.

""Omicron"" was first detected in southern Africa in November. Experts believe that it may pose a threat because it spreads much faster than other strains that have been detected during the pandemic, and contains a large number of mutations.

* Latest UNEP Emissions Gap Report finds new and updated Nationally Determined Contributions only take 7.5% off predicted 2030 emissions, while 55% is needed to meet the 1.5°C Paris goal
* Latest climate promises for 2030 put the world on track for a temperature rise this century of at least 2.7°C
* Net-zero commitments could shave off another 0.5°C, if these pledges were made robust and if 2030 promises were made consistent with the net-zero commitments

**Nairobi, 26 October 2021 –** New and updated climate commitments fall far short of what is needed to meet the goals of the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement), leaving the world on track for a global temperature rise of at least 2.7°C this century, according to the UN Environment Programme’s ([UNEP](https://www.unep.org/)) latest *[Emissions Gap Report 2021:The Heat Is On](https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021).*  
  
The report, now in its 12th year, finds that countries’ updated Nationally Determined Contributions ([NDCs](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs)) – and other commitments made for 2030 but not yet submitted in an updated NDC – only take an additional 7.5 per cent off predicted annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, compared to the previous round of commitments. Reductions of 30 per cent are needed to stay on the least-cost pathway for 2°C and 55 per cent for 1.5°C.  
  
Released ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), the latest round of climate talks taking place in Glasgow, the report finds that net-zero pledges could make a big difference. If fully implemented, these pledges could bring the predicted global temperature rise to 2.2°C, providing hope that further action could still head off the most-catastrophic impacts of climate change. However, net-zero pledges are still vague, incomplete in many cases, and inconsistent with most 2030 NDCs.

“Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is a now problem,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions: eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The clock is ticking loudly.”  
  
As of 30 September 2021, 120 countries, representing just over half of global greenhouse gas emissions, had communicated new or updated NDCs. In addition, three G20 members have announced other new mitigation pledges for 2030.

To have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, the world has eight years to take an additional 28 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) off annual emissions, over and above what is promised in the updated NDCs and other 2030 commitments. To put this number into perspective, carbon dioxide emissions alone are expected to reach 33 gigatonnes in 2021. When all other greenhouse gases are taken into account, annual emissions are close to 60 GtCO2e. So, to have a chance of reaching the 1.5°C target, we need to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions. For the 2°C target, the additional need is lower: a drop in annual emissions of 13 GtCO2e by 2030.

# Sustainable Aviation: Increased cost of greener aviation will curtail pax demand

By [Kristiane Sherry](#)  |

**Matt Gorman, Sustainability Aviation’s chair, notes that sustainable flying will cost more.**

**Cost increases associated with the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mean flights will become more expensive and demand will be hit, UK industry group Sustainable Aviation has said.**

In its Net Zero Carbon Road-Map, the aviation collective, which counts UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and air navigation service providers as members, also said the UK risked losing a potential of 60,000 jobs and its position as a global leader in air travel sustainability without more government support. 

In its updated strategy document, it confirmed that UK aviation can continue to grow while meeting its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The launch of the report coincides with the Sustainable Skies World Summit, taking place this week in Farnborough, UK.

In addition to celebrating the UK’s pioneering role in the development of SAF (*at least eight producers are planning plants in the country, in addition to the active Philipps 66 site on the Humber*), the report praises advances in airspace modernisation.

Yet it points to the “reality” that the increased cost of decarbonising aviation will “inevitably reduce passenger demand”.

“The demand reduction due to the costs of decarbonisation represents around 14 percent of the industry’s reduction in CO2 emissions,” Sustainable Aviation said in a statement. 

“However, this modelling also shows that, even with slightly higher costs, people still want to fly, with overall growth in passenger numbers of almost 250 million by 2050.”

In his opening address in the report, Matt Gorman, Chair, Sustainable Aviation, said: “Increased costs for industry and consumers could have some impact on future demand for air travel, but our work shows that significant ongoing growth can be achieved at the same time as decarbonising aviation.” 

Sustainable Aviation estimates that 9.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) could be saved due to the decarbonisation cost impact on demand.

Other measures which will contribute to meeting the net-zero carbon commitment include fleet upgrades and direct and direct air capture methods. 

The full Net Zero Carbon Road-Map can be found on Sustainable Aviation’s website. 

**The projected pathway to net-zero carbon for the UK’s aviation industry.**

“This is the critical decade where aviation must prove it will decarbonise,” Gorman said in a statement.

“Our updated Net Zero Carbon Road Map shows that we have a clear, credible path to take the carbon out of flying. Through a combination of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, more efficient aircraft and airspace, zero emission planes and carbon removals, we can protect the huge benefits of aviation for future generations without the carbon cost.”

Shai Weiss, CEO, Virgin Atlantic, added: “This Road-Map highlights the critical role that Sustainable Aviation Fuel will need to play in decarbonising UK aviation. 

“As well as helping to meet our collective net zero 2050 goal, a UK SAF industry supports our energy security and creates economic growth through an innovative new green industry. 

“With the right level of Government support and partnership across industry we can make this vision a reality, securing a more su",2023.0,POTENTIALLY CHECKABLE,"The claim asserts specific, factual outcomes (job loss, cost increases, demand levels) that can be examined using existing economic and industry data, making it suitable for verification.","- claim_source: Sustainable Aviation (UK industry group)

The German Bundestag has approved the list of parties and political associations that will participate in the European Parliament elections this year.

As reported by [Ukrinform](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3846432-u-nimeccini-na-vibori-do-evroparlamentu-zareestruvali-35-politsil.html), a total of 35 parties have been registered to compete for seats in the main legislative body of the EU.

Some of these parties are known for their controversial activities: for example, ""The Last Generation"" - a movement that carries out acts of vandalism allegedly to draw attention to environmental issues.

Other parties have quite interesting names: for example, ""The Party of Reason"" or ""The Party of Traditional Medical Research on Rejuvenation"".

In this year's European Parliament elections, the voting age will be lowered for the first time: the right to vote has been granted not only to adults but also to children from the age of 16.

The voting will take place on June 6-9.

# Two thirds of Poles oppose adoption of the euro, poll shows

Share

According to a survey released over the Easter weekend an overwhelming majority of Poles oppose entry into the common-currency Eurozone, preferring to keep the Polish złoty.

A poll conducted by the United Surveysagency for news portal *Wirtualna Polska* (*WP*)found that 67 per cent of respondents were against any attempt to replace the złoty with the euro, with 27 per cent backing the idea.

Adoption of the common currency was opposed by 52 per cent of voters who, at the last elections, supported parties that now form the Government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Just 37 per cent of pro-Government voters were willing to consider ditching the złoty.

[![]()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=earrcf0O9Ls&t=7s)

The strongest opposition to the introduction of the euro was from voters who backed the Conservatives (PiS) or the right-wing Confederation party at the last elections, with 95 per cent against adopting the common currency.

The parties that make up the ruling coalition – the Civic Coalition led by Tusk, the Third Way alliance and the Left party – are in favour signing up for the common currency but have indicated there would be no such move any time soon.

Finance minister Andrzej Domański stated in March that Poland has not, as yet, met the criteria for joining the ERM II mechanism pegging the złoty to the euro for a period before the European bloc’s currency is officially adopted.

Both the PiS and Confederation are opposed to Poland adopting the euro, citing what they said were negative experiences for southern Europe and price rises in neighbouring Baltic states and Slovakia.

The governor of Poland’s central bank (NBP) Adam Glapiński has said he would not support any such move until the Polish GDP per head was around that of Germany’s. He is currently facing an attempt to oust him by the Tusk Government over an alleged failure to control inflation.

Membership of ERM II requires Glapiński and Domański to apply to the European Central Bank, proposing a fixed rate of the złoty to the euro, requiring the Polish central bank to maintain that set value with only 15 per cent variations either way.

(PiS) MP Zbigniew Kuzmiuk told *Brussels Signal*: “The attempt to oust Glapiński has been caused by his staunch opposition to making any moves towards adoption of the euro, which he is capable of blocking as joining the ERM II mechanism is not possible without consent of a country’s central bank.”

The PiS also pointed to the fact that the Polish Constitution would need to be changed for the złoty to be replaced by the euro and to do that a two-thirds majority in favour in Parliament would have to be secured.

Poland joining the ERM II mechanism would be possible as long as the head of the central bank consented.

Adopting the European common currency was part of Poland’s European Union accession treaty, although no deadline for doing so was agreed.

The previous Tusk-led government (2007-2015) considered such a move but backed out amid the financial crisis of 2008. The then-finance minister Jacek Rostowski persuaded Tusk that Poland retaining the złoty was a useful tool enabling devaluation to avoid a deep recession.

Poland’s political parties are currently occupied by elections at the regional, municipal and county levels on April 7. Campaigning for the European Parliament elections in June is yet to begin.

The fact that Poles continue to oppose adopting the euro will likely become a focus of the PiS campaign in the European elections, while it will probably be an issue the ruling coalition would prefer to side-step.

# Mostly True: Inflation issue that most concerns Portuguese in 2024 EU elections

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20788%20788'%2F%3E ""chart02-mostlytrue"")

**The [March 2024 IPSOS poll exclusively for Euronews](https://pt.euronews.com/2024/03/25/sondagem-euronews-inflacao-e-a-grande-preocupacao-dos-europeus-portugueses-sao-os-mais-ala) reveals that fighting inflation is the top priority for Portuguese citizens. However, Portuguese voters are also concerned about social inequalities and economic growth, with little difference between the three issues.**

In fact, in March 2024, less than three months before the European elections, 84% of Portuguese voters were more concerned about rising prices. In turn, 14% considered the fight against inflation to be important, but not a priority, in contrast to the 2% who believed it to be merely a secondary issue.

![](https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/euronews2.png)

The IPSOS poll for Euronews, carried out in 18 European countries in the run-up to the elections, seeks to find out the main priorities of European citizens in these European elections: fighting inflation; reducing social inequalities and preserving social protection systems; economic growth; illegal immigration; fighting unemployment; and climate change. In Portugal, the sample is made up of 2,000 people.

With regard to the fight against social inequalities, 82% of the Portuguese point to this issue as another top priority. However, 82% of voters also consider a Europe-wide intervention necessary to stimulate Portugal’s economic growth.

The differences lie in the other categories. 15% of Portuguese respondents consider the fight against social inequalities to be important, but not a priority, and 3% somewhat secondary. With regard to economic growth, 17% said it was important, but not a priority, and 1% said it was secondary.

![](https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/euronews4.png)

#### **Inflation is also the top priority for European citizens**

According to the same survey, as in Portugal, [inflation is the issue](https://pt.euronews.com/2024/03/25/sondagem-euronews-inflacao-e-a-grande-preocupacao-dos-europeus-portugueses-sao-os-mais-ala) that most worries the rest of Europe’s citizens. In fact, more than two thirds of those surveyed (68%) are concerned about the rise in the cost of living due to the inflationary crisis of 2023, felt above all in the rise in food prices.

![](https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/euronews5.png)

In second place, 64% of voters demand a reduction in social inequalities and the preservation of social protection systems. In third place in the table is concern about economic growth. The fourth priority is the fight against illegal immigration (59%), which reflects the growth of the far right in Europe. In fifth place is the fight against unemployment (57%) and, finally, the response to climate change (52%).

#### **A previous study also indicated the economic crisis as the Portuguese’s biggest concern**

Political scientists Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, who conducted [a study based on a January 2024 European Council on Foreign Relations](https://ecfr.eu/publication/a-crisis-of-ones-own-the-politics-of-trauma-in-europes-election-year/) (ECFR) poll in 11 European countries, including Portugal, suggested that European voters are divided into five “crisis tribes” that correspond to the five biggest concerns: climate change, global economic turmoil, immigration, the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

### **The European People's Party (PPE) candidate for the presidency of the European Commission and current president of the institution, [Ursula von der Leyen](https://www.stiripesurse.ro/tag/Ursula-von-der-Leyen), stated on Monday that she does not exclude the possibility of banning [TikTok](https://www.stiripesurse.ro/tag/tiktok) in the European Union if she is re-elected for a new term after the European Parliament elections in June, according to EFE, as reported by Agerpres.**

""It's not excluded,"" Von der Leyen said during the first debate before the European elections, when asked if, in the event of her re-election, she would ban TikTok in the EU due to its ties with China, as the United States is considering.

The European Commission was ""the first institution in the world"" to ban the installation of TikTok on corporate phones, and it is well aware of the ""TikTok danger,"" the PPE candidate emphasized.

She also highlighted that, under her leadership, the European executive has ""done a lot"" to regulate services so that platforms are responsible for the content they provide, as well as digital markets, to ensure that large companies do not act as gatekeepers and to provide fair access to them.

Von der Leyen made these statements just a week before meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Paris as part of the European tour that the Chinese leader will undertake next week. The tour will include visits to France, Hungary, and Serbia, and will be Xi's first trip to Europe in the past five years.

The possibility of banning the social network in the United States was also marked by the visit of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to Beijing, after the US Senate approved a bill that would require the Chinese company ByteDance, which created TikTok, to sell the popular video app if it does not want the platform to be banned in the US.

In the EU, TikTok suspended its Lite version points program on Wednesday, which it had launched in Spain and France, after the European Commission warned that the new app had been launched without first publishing the risk analysis report required by European legislation on digital services.

However, the platform sent this report to the European executive, which will now analyze it, thus avoiding a fine of up to 1% of its global turnover, which Brussels had threatened.

**Overall Temperature Records**

# Last Twelve Months Warmer Than Ever Measured

By Heleen Ekker · ·  Updated:

RTL News

**The past twelve months have been the warmest period ever recorded, with temperatures 1.3 degrees Celsius higher than in pre-industrial times (around 1850). There is a clear link with human-caused climate change. This is evident from research by Climate Central, an independent group of climate scientists.**

They conducted this research in the run-up to a new global climate summit, which starts at the end of this month in Dubai. It is known that the current climate policy of all countries combined is insufficient to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.

Earlier this year, there were already reports of record temperatures being measured in individual months. The researchers warn that temperatures will continue to rise and the weather will become more extreme until world leaders ensure that greenhouse gas emissions decrease.

## **Extreme Heatwaves**

In the analysis, the researchers looked at various locations around the world to see how much climate change affects temperature. One in four people worldwide (1.9 billion people) experienced extreme heatwaves during this period. This heat is often accompanied by severe air pollution.

During the year, 90% of all people (7.3 billion) experienced a period of at least ten hot days that have become more extreme due to climate change.

## El Niño

The weather phenomenon El Niño and the reduction of emissions from shipping, which made the air cleaner but also increased solar radiation, played a small role. A much larger factor is the burning of fossil fuels.

Researcher Friederike Otto says: ""Only a small part of the 1.3-degree warming is due to natural variability. The largest part is caused by greenhouse gas emissions.""

## Situation in the Netherlands

The situation in the Netherlands was not particularly notable over the past twelve months. ""Actually, the Netherlands has dodged the bullet in that period,"" says Bart Verheggen of the KNMI. But according to him, the research clearly shows that people all over the world are now living in a different climate than 150 years ago. ""Especially the extremes stand out, and it's precisely these that have a significant impact on people's lives.""

In the report, the researchers highlight various weather extremes. For example, large parts of South America were much warmer than average during the first half of last year. In the United States, more than 380 people died in over 20 different weather extremes, and the damage totaled nearly $70 billion.

Canada and Hawaii were hit by large wildfires. In Hawaii, 93 people lost their lives. There were also consequences in the EU. In part of Spain, for example, the driest period in 500 years occurred. Extreme weather in Africa claimed the lives of 15,700 people.

# More supporters of complete confiscation of Russian assets in European Parliament - DW

3 minutes.

However, for now, the EU is only ready to transfer to Ukraine the bank interest accrued on these assets.

In the European Parliament, there are increasingly more supporters of the idea of complete confiscation and transfer to Ukraine of frozen Russian assets. This is reported by [DW](https://www.dw.com/uk/zmusiti-rf-platiti-dedali-bilse-evrodeputativ-za-konfiskaciu-aktiviv/a-68905106?maca=ukr-rss-ukr-all-1496-rdf).

The day before, a debate was held in the European Parliament on the use of frozen assets of the Russian Central Bank ""to support Ukraine's victory and recovery"". As the publication notes, ""the majority of deputies"" during this discussion supported the European Commission's proposal to transfer bank profits from these assets to military aid to Ukraine.

However, this refers specifically to the interest accrued on Russian deposits stored in Europe. ""Many parliamentarians insist that this is not enough. They presented various arguments in favor of confiscating the entire amount of Russian assets to support Ukraine – approximately 300 billion euros, of which about 220 billion are in the European Union,"" DW writes.

The European Parliament's special rapporteur on Russia, Andrius Kubilius, emphasized that such confiscation would be entirely legitimate, as international law and UN recommendations give states the right to apply countermeasures to force an aggressor to fulfill its legal obligations.

Kubilius recalled that the United States had resorted to such actions with state funds of Iran in 1981 and Iraq in 1992 to compensate for the damage caused to Kuwait. And now, after approval by Congress, the US administration will apply this mechanism to confiscate $20 billion in Russian assets frozen in the United States.

However, the pro-Russian lobby in the European Parliament insists that such confiscation is allegedly ""piracy"". In particular, this was stated by ""independent"" deputy from Slovakia Katarína Roth-Nevěďalová and two Irish parliamentarians from the Left Party, who usually take a pro-Russian position.

Closing the debate, the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, assured that for now, the European Union does not plan to confiscate the frozen assets of the Russian Central Bank, ""because there is not enough clarity on what we can and cannot do"". ""Of course, we would be very happy if we could take these 300 billion euros,"" Borrell said. ""We will continue to study this issue and seek legal assistance to understand what else is possible.""

Violence and Discrimination

## Amateur Football Match Abandonments – DFB Releases Shocking Numbers

Published on 08/29/2023, Reading time: 2 minutes

The German Football Association (DFB) has presented its assessment of the current state of amateur football. The numbers regarding violence and discrimination are alarming, remaining at a high level. This has prompted the organization's leaders to increase preventive measures.

In the past season, 961 amateur football matches were abandoned due to violence and discrimination. The DFB announced this on Monday when presenting its assessment. DFB Vice President Ronny Zimmermann described the number as ""not satisfactory."" ""We must intensify our efforts. We have stopped the trend, but the numbers are stagnating at a high level."" He added, ""There are still too many people being harmed. This is an image that football cannot live with.""

 Alone, 126 matches involving F-, E-, and D-youth teams (ages 6-12) were terminated prematurely due to violence and discrimination. The overall abandonment rate remains unchanged at 0.08%, despite an increase in the number of games played.

According to the DFB, there were 6,224 incidents on amateur pitches during the past season, accounting for 0.5% of all games with a completed match report. A player was identified as the perpetrator 4,116 times, a coach 1,191 times, and a spectator 2,200 times.

### ""This must be a final warning signal""

Mostly, referees are overrepresented in the group of victims. This is because they are solely responsible for game management in the lower divisions.

Following the death of a 15-year-old Berliner after a violent attack by an opponent during a youth tournament in Frankfurt am Main, Zimmermann will remember the past season negatively. ""Beyond all statistics, we must acknowledge that a person lost their life in the past season. This must be a final warning signal, regardless of the role one plays in sports,"" he said.

To prevent violence and discrimination on the football pitch, Zimmermann is focusing on preventive measures. In addition to numerous projects, contact points have been established in all 21 state associations. ""It's about raising awareness,"" Zimmermann said. ""Something terrible can happen anywhere and anytime, so we must all be more vigilant and address negative developments early on.""

# Technological openness instead of symbolic politics – against a general speed limit on highways

## This is what we Free Democrats stand for:

Instead of relying on bans, we focus on innovations and technological openness. We Free Democrats decisively reject a general speed limit on [highways](https://www.fdp.de/baustopp-fuer-autobahnen-und-bundesstrassen-waere-unverantwortlich). For safe and [climate-friendly mobility](https://www.fdp.de/das-ziel-ist-klimaneutrale-mobilitaet) that is also affordable, we don't need a speed limit or a ban on combustion engines, but rather a well-maintained infrastructure network and intelligent traffic management. To reduce emissions, we Free Democrats rely on international emissions trading and innovative technologies such as intelligent guidance systems that help drivers avoid traffic jams and detours. This prevents congested traffic, which increases the risk of accidents and CO2 emissions.

* No general speed limit on highways
* Safety and climate protection through [technological openness](https://www.fdp.de/technologieoffenheit-und-praxistauglichkeit-sichergestellt)
* Expansion of emissions trading

[Arguments for download](https://www.fdp.de/sites/default/files/2024-04/20240403_argumente_tempolimit.pdf)

## But doesn't a speed limit make highways safer and help us save a lot of CO2?

No, neither is true. The [highways](https://www.fdp.de/bundesregierung-und-autobauer-bei-diesel-nachruestung-der-pflicht) in Germany are among our safest roads. We have a safety problem on country roads. Also, in international comparison, no connection can be found between a general speed limit and a higher level of safety on [highways](https://www.fdp.de/baustopp-fuer-autobahnen-und-bundesstrassen-waere-unverantwortlich). Moreover, monotonous driving with constant speed over longer distances contributes to an increased risk of accidents. We must support innovative technologies and their development, which improve the safety of [mobility](https://www.fdp.de/das-ziel-ist-klimaneutrale-mobilitaet). Guidance systems can also make traffic more fluid and safer. In addition to road safety, it is often claimed that the speed limit has a positive impact on climate protection. A study commissioned by the FDP parliamentary group shows that only 1.1 million tons of CO2 could be saved through a speed limit – at high economic costs. Instead of using inefficient symbolic measures and bans to protect the climate, we Free Democrats rely on innovations and new technologies for smooth and congestion-free traffic.

## Why do we rely on emissions trading?

To effectively combat [climate change](https://www.fdp.de/der-klimawandel-ist-eine-menschheitsaufgabe), we rely on the opportunities offered by modern technologies. The goal must therefore be to establish an international emissions trading system as quickly as possible. To do this, the global climate club must be expanded and supplemented by an agreement on the alignment of a uniform emissions trading system. Guided by economic incentives, [emissions trading](https://www.fdp.de/klimaziele-durch-emissionshandel-garantiert-erreichen) promotes innovative technologies, such as the use of climate-friendly engines and fuels.

**03 Executive Summary**

Although the effects of demographic change on social insurance systems are only slightly noticeable so far, the end of the grace period is approaching. The shortage of skilled workers on the labor market is becoming increasingly severe, and the political discussion about measures to attract migrants is gaining momentum. The question arises as to whether labor migration can actually relieve public households in the future. Against this background, this publication analyzes the fiscal effects of migration based on the updated generational accounting for 2023.

To determine the fiscal balance, the current average per-capita payments of foreigners living in the country are used for future migrants, and an integration period of six years is assumed. In particular, the assumed six-year integration period leads to lower net payments by future migrants compared to the native population, resulting in a significant increase in the sustainability gap from 447.8 to 497.1 percent of GDP. In a hypothetical scenario without any future migration flows, the sustainability gap would be 347.4 percent of GDP, which is 149.7 percentage points lower. The fiscal balance of future immigration is therefore negative and amounts to almost one and a half times the current annual economic performance, assuming 293,000 immigrants per year. However, the remaining high sustainability gap in the hypothetical case without migration shows that the actual problems are less due to migration and more due to an overly generous (welfare) state that lives beyond its means in the long term.

One option for reducing the financial burden of migration is to implement migration policy measures that aim to improve the qualification structure of future migrants. Under optimistic assumptions, these measures could be designed to ensure that half of the migrants have a vocational training or a university degree, which would reduce the sustainability gap by 64 percentage points.

Another possibility for reducing the financial burden of migration is to implement migration policy measures that promote additional labor migration. In contrast to the annual net migration of 293,000 people in the reference scenario, this scenario assumes additional immigration of...

EUROPEAN COMMISSION 
Ursula von der Leyen 
The President 
Brussels, 25 June 2024 

Dear colleagues,

When people look back, 2024 will be seen as a landmark year for EU migration and asylum policy with the adoption and entry into force of the Pact on Migration and Asylum.

Working hand in hand on the internal and external dimension of migration, we have achieved historic results. The two-track approach that we started to apply, with a legislative and operational track including the implementation of comprehensive agreements with our neighbours as well as countries of origin and transit, has created the necessary political conditions to find agreement on the Pact. This will be seen as the moment when, after years of often divisive discussions, we succeeded in finding the difficult balance between our intersecting needs and challenges and agree on an ambitious but fair way forward. Our work together on migration and asylum will require constant effort and vigilance, but we can take satisfaction in having reached this agreement, and the foundations it sets for future action.

Our common task is now to make this agreement a reality. We have just 24 months to prepare before the Pact enters into application in June 2026, and we must not underestimate the work ahead. Every Member State needs to engage in rigorous preparations reviewing and adapting current legislation; putting in place systems for legal counselling and monitoring; developing IT systems, infrastructure and reception facilities particularly for the border procedure; amending administrative practices and coordination between authorities at national level; integrating EU Agencies ’ work within national systems, as well as building and strengthening capacity, through recruitment and training of personnel.

The Common Implementation Plan for the Pact adopted by the Commission on 12 June breaks down the new obligations into ten building blocks and itemises the work to be done in each case - by the Commission, by Member States, and by EU agencies. It is designed to provide a maximum of support to Member States in this major undertaking. That is why the Commission has brought it forward three months earlier than legally required in order to give national authorities the longest time possible to draw up their National Implementation Plans, which are due by mid-December this year.

Commission européenne/Europese Commissie, 1049 Bruxelles/Brussel, BELGIQUE/BELGIË - Tel. +32 2299 lill Ref. Ares(2024)4570130 - 25/06/2024 

The spirit of the Pact is one of solidarity to ensure that no Member State is left alone to face migratory pressure. By the same token, no administration will be left alone with the challenges of preparing for Europe ’s new coordinated approach to managing migration. The Commission will help coordinate these efforts and will be there to support Member States every step of the way. EU support can take many forms - from legal guidance to help ensure compliance with the legal texts, to very practical and financial support. The Commission is already engaging Member State-by-Member State to underpin planning for the work ahead with joint gap and needs analysis.

As we agreed in February, to supplement funding from national budgets, Member States will be able to draw on existing as well as newly available resources from the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Border Management and Visa Instrument, as well as other available EU resources, such as cohesion policy funds as well as technical assistance support. The mid-term review of the national programmes under these regulations will be the occasion to allocate more than EUR 1.6 billion for both funds, and the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework resulted in an increase of EUR 2 billion for migration and border management over the years 2025-2027 to support with the implementation of the Pact, and with refugees from Ukraine, for whom temporary protection is now extended till March 2026.

More and more people in Germany are living a vegan lifestyle. In 2021, there were 1.41 million German vegans, up from 800,000 in 2015. The trend is clear, but what are the effects of a vegan diet?

Those who live a vegan lifestyle have removed animal products from their diet, including meat, cheese, eggs, dairy products, and honey. Those who strictly adhere to the vegan lifestyle also avoid leather and other forms of animal exploitation.

The motivations for a vegan lifestyle are diverse: many vegans have chosen a plant-based diet to no longer support factory farming. The ecological footprint and the impact of diet on the climate also drive vegans. But does a vegan diet really help in the fight against climate change?

## Vegan Diet Reduces Greenhouse Gases

A vegan diet produces around 40% fewer CO2 emissions, according to the Federal Environmental Agency. In concrete terms, a vegan emits 610 kilograms less carbon dioxide per year compared to someone who eats meat, milk, and cheese. This corresponds to about 8% of the average annual CO2 emissions per person and has a significant impact on the climate.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) comes to even more drastic conclusions. According to their calculations, food accounts for about a fifth of our climate footprint in Germany. A person's diet leads to 2.5 tons of greenhouse gases per year, with 69% of those coming from animal sources. A vegan or vegetarian lifestyle therefore protects the climate and reduces the ecological footprint.

## The CO2 Footprint of Food

More than half of all greenhouse gas emissions from food come from animal products. However, plant-based foods can also have a high CO2 footprint. For example, the climate balance of rice is very poor because the fields are often flooded, causing organic matter to rot and release methane.

Organic farming fares better for grains. The energy required for organic wheat production is about a third lower than for conventional grain production, and it is not contaminated with pesticides.

Less common varieties like rye or spelt are fertilized less, resulting in a better nitrogen balance. Some vegetables, such as legumes, even absorb nitrogen from the soil and do not release it back.

## Climate-Friendly Fruits and Vegetables

Organic apples from the region, carrots, and fresh potatoes – the most exemplary fruits and vegetables in terms of CO2 equivalents – are staples on the menu of vegans.

If vegetables are grown in greenhouses or fruit comes from other continents, they have a significantly higher CO2 balance than seasonal and local alternatives.

Unfortunately, a large part of the fruit and vegetables sold in Germany come from abroad. Those who want to live more sustainably need to pay close attention when shopping. More and more experts are therefore advocating for a climate label that, similar to the Nutri-Score, displays the climate balance of a food at a glance.

In addition to transportation, processing and packaging also affect the climate balance: canned vegetables fare better than frozen vegetables, and preservation in glass is the most harmful to the environment. While single-use glass can be recycled, this process is very energy-intensive. For those who prioritize a climate-neutral diet, it's best to grow their own vegetables in their own garden and consume them fresh.

This is definitely a unique achievement in history. But many fans could attend, also, multiple games every day. Everything was close; the players could go back to their hotels, their headquarters, immediately after the game without having to fly somewhere. So, also, from a player’s perspective, it was extremely positive. The weather was perfect, the pitches were perfect, the stadiums were beautiful; everything was fantastic.   

FIFA President reflects on FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™

18 Dec 2023

**On and off the pitch, as you said, it was a unique tournament. What made this one so special?**Well, obviously, most importantly for most of the fans around the world it’s what happens on the pitch and, on the pitch, it was a unique [FIFA] World Cup as well: 172 goals, a record number of goals scored in a FIFA World Cup final tournament. We had three Asian teams, for example, proceeding to the next round. We had an African team for the first time in history in the semi-final, with Morocco. We had excitement, we had surprises, we had heartbeat. And we had, certainly, the best final ever. Thrilling, entertaining, goals here and there, extra time, penalty kicks; I mean, everything. Epic!

Off the pitch, as well, it was an incredible success. We had no incidents whatsoever, we had a joyful atmosphere. We had two million people in the Fan Zone, in the Fan Festival of FIFA. We had fans coming from all over the world and enjoying football. We had eight state-of-the-art stadiums, from Al Bayt, where the opening [ceremony] took place, to Lusail, where the final took place; all eight stadiums were absolutely stunning, fantastic. Over 53,000 spectators per match. Attendance going in, going out of the stadiums, everything ran smoothly.
