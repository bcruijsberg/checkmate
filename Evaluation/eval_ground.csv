# Russia abandons International Space Station: It could fall on Europe!

They say the partnership will only be restored when sanctions are lifted

![Russia abandons International Space Station: It could fall on Europe!](https://phantom.estaticos-marca.com/149e4bc43e9009d5e618c337ffb98dee/resize/1320/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2022/04/03/16490008307804.png)

**Russia** has ended its cooperation with **Western countries** regarding the **International Space Station**, with the country's space director stating on Saturday that the ties would only be restored in the event that the sanctions imposed by the **West** on **Moscow** are lifted.

**Dmitry Rogozin**, the head of **Roscosmos**, said in a social media post that the aim of the sanctions was ""to kill the Russian economy and plunge our people into despair and hunger, to bring our country to its knees."" He added that ""they will not succeed, but the intentions are clear.""

""That is why I believe that the restoration of normal relations between the partners of the **International Space Station (ISS)** and other projects is only possible with the full and unconditional removal of the illegal sanctions imposed,"" **Rogozin** said.

## International Space Station could plunge towards Earth

The **West** has introduced wide-ranging sanctions against **Russia** for what **Moscow** calls a ""special military operation"" in **Ukraine**, which was launched on February 24. Despite the tensions, a [**US astronaut**](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/03/15/622fc081e2704e25918b458d.html) and two **Russian cosmonauts** landed safely in Kazakhstan last Wednesday after leaving the space station aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule.

The end of cooperation will mean, **Rogozin** said, a serious risk of an uncontrolled departure of the station from its orbit and a possible fall onto the territory of the **United States**, **Europe** or other countries.

""There is a possibility that this 500-tonne structure could fall over **Europe** and also over **India** and **China**. The **ISS** does not fly over **Russia**, so all the risks are theirs. Are they prepared for that?"" the **Roscosmos** chief warned.

![Bulgaria: 63% of Transactions in Bulgaria are made in Cash](https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_verybig_214573.jpg)

**Bulgaria** is second in Europe after Romania in the number of **cash** payments, according to statistics from ‘Global Findex’. In our country, 63% of transactions are made with **cash**, and in our neighbor - over 78%. Although the pandemic was expected to increase the digitalization of **money** and minimize physical **cash** and its applicability, data show that consumers in Europe still prefer **cash** payments.

**European countries in which **cash** transactions are predominant are:**

1. Romania

2. **Bulgaria**

3. The Czech Republic

4. Ukraine

5. Hungary

6. Slovakia

7. Greece

With over 70% and 63% of the total number of **cash** transactions, Romania and **Bulgaria** are the countries with the highest need for physical **money** in Europe. Also, 42% of the population of Romania and 28% of the population of **Bulgaria** do not have a bank account - this is indicative of the dependence of local consumers on physical banknotes and coins.

Other European countries are on the other financial pole, such as Norway, where only 3% of transactions are made in cash. Also, this country has an impressively low number of ATMs - only 32 per 100,000 population, but still 100% of adults in the country have a bank account.

*“In **Bulgaria**, and in Europe, there is a strong attachment of consumers to **money** and **cash** payments. Our expectations are that **cash** will survive the digital revolution and that people will continue to use it for many years to come as their preferred payment method,”* said Kalina Stoykin, Regional Manager of Euronet in **Bulgaria**, one of the largest payment companies in the world.

Euronet recently launched a large-scale campaign in **Bulgaria**, aimed at creating quick and easy access to **cash** in remote areas in Bulgaria. The **ATM** for the Community initiative is designed specifically for municipalities that want to offer **cash** withdrawals to their residents. More information about the project can be found [**here**](https://www.euronetatms.bg/%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d0%b1%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8/%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%bc-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%89%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d1%82%d0%b0/).

**Why are **cash** payments preferred?**

1. **Cash** payment is satisfactory

A [**study**](https://cashessentials.org/coffee-tastes-better-when-paid-with-cash/) conducted by Prof. Avni M. Shah shows that paying in **cash** is a way to add positive emotion to transactions, which promotes cost satisfaction.

2. **Cash** makes us sensible buyers

Using **cash** helps to avoid impulsive purchases. A study of consumer psychology conducted among thousands of households shows that people who pay in **cash** spend less and have a larger share of health products in their basket.

3. **Cash** brings security

ATMs are a technique and as such can break down or run out of cash. At such times, the availability of physical **cash** will ensure trouble-free shopping.

4. Cache helps with budgeting

Paying in **cash** helps to avoid overspending while shopping. Carrying a certain amount acts as a brake for consumers to spend extra when their wallet is empty.

The number of suicide attempts has increased by around 400 percent during the second lockdown compared to the time before Corona. Up to **500 children** had to be treated in intensive care units after suicide attempts between March and the end of May 2021 nationwide.

This is the result of a **study by the University Hospital of Essen**, which the head of the pediatric intensive care unit, Professor Christoph Dohna-Schwake, reported exclusively in the ""WAZ"" video talk ""19 - the Chef's Visit"". The dramatic development, which emerges from data from 27 German pediatric intensive care units, has ""surprised"" him, according to Dohna-Schwake.

### Suicide Attempts in Children: The Long Lockdown as a Possible Cause

The lockdown and school closures in the spring of last year had a ""sticky"" effect, Dohna-Schwake explained, regarding possible causes for this sad development. The social isolation associated with the lockdown had particularly affected children who had already suffered from depression or anxiety disorders.

Research shows that ""social contacts outside of social media have a preventive effect"" against such mental illnesses, Dohna-Schwake emphasized.

### Schools Should Remain Open ""As Long As Possible""

Based on the study submitted for international publication, his recommendation is to keep schools open ""as long as possible"".

In the **video podcast ""19 - the Chef's Visit""**, the head of the University Hospital of Essen, Professor Jochen A. Werner, provides guidance on the current developments of the Corona pandemic, together with journalist Jens de Buhr and changing guests, from Monday to Friday. The Funke Media Group accompanies the show. All episodes are available at any time in the [media library](https://dup-magazin.de/chefvisite/) on [DUP-magazin.de](https://dup-magazin.de/).

# China's graphite dominance threatens electric car market

A rise in demand for electric cars is boosting demand for graphite, a key battery component. As battery and car makers try to secure supplies, China's domination of the graphite market has become a problem.

![A worker covered in graphite dust at a warehouse where graphite is processed]( ""A worker covered in graphite dust at a warehouse where graphite is processed"")

Ripples of last year's power crunch in China are still being felt by global battery and electric-car makers.

A shortage of coal supplies caused by an Indonesian export ban, a trade war with major supplier Australia and a steep rise in post-COVID-19 domestic demand prompted local Chinese authorities to ration power to energy-intensive industries, including graphite.

The rolling power blackouts as well as the suspension of graphite production in winter further squeezed global graphite supply, already struggling to keep up with strong demand for lithium-ion batteries as [global electric vehicle sales went through the roof.](/en/tesla-posts-sales-of-almost-1-million-cars-in-2021/a-60313972)

As a result, the mineral, which has often been overlooked when it comes to battery materials, has added to the troubles of battery and car manufacturers, who have been scouring the planet to secure supplies of other battery constituents like lithium, nickel and cobalt.

The supply squeeze, which has driven up graphite prices, has yet again turned the focus on the global overreliance on China for graphite, the biggest component in lithium-ion batteries by volume with few viable alternatives.

![Electric car getting charged]()

China dominates the global graphite market, producing almost all of the graphite that's used for anode, the negative end of a lithium-ion battery.

""We hardly have any supply in Europe to even scratch the surface of future graphite demand for the lithium-ion battery industry so far,"" Burkhard Straube, the head of the graphite solutions unit at SGL Carbon, told DW.

""Without the further development of a European battery value chain including raw materials and components I would be highly concerned how companies in Europe as well as in North America would satisfy the demand for instance for graphite in the future,"" he told DW.

## Graphite shortfall

Graphite is a crystalline form of carbon. It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity and is chemically inert with high thermal resistance and lubricity. These properties make the mineral almost irreplaceable in a vast array of industries ranging from semiconductors to nuclear reactors. It is an abundant mineral around the world but is also produced synthetically.

The demand for graphite has received a major boost from the auto industry that is undergoing a transition to electric vehicles (EV), powered by lithium-ion batteries, for now.

Tens of millions of EVs are expected to hit the roads in the next decade as part of global net-zero carbon pledges, driving a fivefold increase in demand for anodes by 2030, according to BloombergNEF. Graphite producers are unlikely to meet the massive demand at the current rate of production.

The world could witness a deficit of 85,000 tons of the mineral this year alone with electric vehicle sales expected to touch 10 million units, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence analyst George Miller told DW.

""Graphite is often a very underrepresented critical mineral in the lithium-ion battery,"" Miller said. ""Especially, not enough attention is paid to the potential for supply deficit and to the potential for the graphite market itself to become structurally affected by demand from electric vehicles.""

Graphite flake prices in China stood at $760 per ton in early February, up by 11.8% from January and up by 38.2% from a year ago, according to Rystad Energy's monthly price index.

The deficit is likely to keep graphite prices elevated for a while, further boosting battery costs which are already under pressure from high li";2022

DW reports on how much German teachers earn and how they work, as well as how to become a teacher in Germany.

![German school]( ""German school"")

In Germany, if flowers or small gifts are given to school teachers, it's usually at the end of the school year, not at the beginning. In general, giving gifts to teachers is not common practice. And for those who still want to do so, they should be cautious. The fact is that school teachers are considered public sector employees (Öffentlicher Dienst) and are not allowed to accept expensive gifts, even on holidays. The federal states decide on the maximum value of gifts individually. In Berlin, for example, joint gifts from students worth more than 30 euros are not prohibited, but gifts worth more than that require reporting to the school administration.

Teachers should decline gifts worth more than 50 euros, as these require approval from the city's education department. There is also a list of [prohibited gifts](/ru/zapretnye-podarki-v-nemeckih-skolah/a-19518087): plane tickets, gift certificates, travel discounts.

## How to become a teacher in Germany

In Germany, teachers are trained for primary and secondary schools, as well as for high schools (Gymnasien). Those who want to teach in high schools attend a university, not a university of applied sciences (Fachhochschule). There, they learn scientific teaching methods and thoroughly study their subjects.

In Germany, a teacher teaches two subjects in school at the same time. Combinations can vary: geography and art, mathematics and literature. During their studies, future teachers take two state exams - Erstes Staatsexamen and Zweites Staatsexamen. Between them, they must complete a school internship (Referendariat), which lasts about a year and a half. Those who come from other countries with a teaching degree will have to validate their diploma and take additional courses to teach another subject.

![Teacher in a mask]()

## How much do teachers earn in Germany

A teacher's salary in Germany depends on the federal state, the presence of a civil servant status (Beamter), and the type of school where they work. For example, a high school teacher earns more than a primary school teacher. [In any case, teachers earn a salary above the national average.](/ru/сколько-получают-учителя-в-германии/a-50184414)

According to the Gehalt.de portal, with a 40-hour workweek, this is approximately 3,000 to 5,000 euros per month gross. In addition to a good salary, the status of a civil servant provides many benefits and a higher pension. Teachers without German citizenship cannot become civil servants.

## Shortage of primary school teachers

The profession of a teacher in Germany is definitely [promising](/ru/где-хотят-работать-молодые-немцы/a-19510358). According to statistics, due to the baby boom in German families and the influx of migrants, several hundred new primary schools will have to be opened in the coming years. Meanwhile, according to the German Teachers' Union (Deutsche Lehrerverband), the country is already lacking tens of thousands of specialists. For now, this problem is being addressed at the regional level in various ways - for example, by combining classes.

In German schools, there are significantly more female teachers than male teachers. If we take the statistics for 2019-2020, the share of women among teachers in German primary schools was 89.39%, and in high schools - 60.46%.

## How to become a teacher without special education

Due to the shortage of teachers in Germany, it has become possible to become a teacher even without a special diploma. For example, people with a master's degree in technical or humanitarian sciences can practice in schools and take additional pedagogical courses at the same time. In 2017 alone, 4,400 such specialists were hired in German schools. Teachers without a teaching diploma can earn around 2,900 euros per month before taxes.

# Energy Transition Is the ""Dark Doldrums"" a Threat in Winter?

Status: 07.03.2021 08:39 Uhr

**Germany is gradually phasing out nuclear and coal power. But what happens when the country is only supplied with renewable energy: What if neither the sun shines nor the wind blows?**

When it gets cold and dark in winter, Germans consume more electricity than usual: heating systems, lights, and televisions are used more when people stay indoors. So far, so normal. But this could become a problem, warns Professor Harald Schwarz from the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus.

Because when it's dark, no solar power is produced: ""Then photovoltaic production is de facto zero, even though we have installed solar panels with 50 gigawatts of capacity in Germany."" If there is no breeze at the same time, wind power also largely fails. ""We're talking about 2 to 5 gigawatts of actual capacity, even though plants with 60 gigawatts of capacity have been installed,"" Schwarz specifies. What arises is the so-called ""cold dark doldrums.""

## Will ""Day X"" Become a Serious Problem?

The horror scenario is an extreme situation that theoretically only occurs on a few days a year. But these ""Days X"" could decide in the future whether the energy transition with the nuclear and coal phase-out will succeed. Because until now, Germany could always rely on its conventional power plants in an emergency - mainly from coal and nuclear power.

But precisely these power plants will be shut down in the coming years. According to Schwarz, Germany is threatened with a classic ""power gap"" - even if only on a few days. ""Already in 2023, we will be missing 15 to 20 gigawatts of secure capacity,"" says Schwarz - and that will become a problem on a ""Day X.""

In the following years, the problem will worsen - because the nuclear phase-out is immediately followed by the gradual phase-out of coal-fired power generation. And power storage facilities are not yet able to solve the problem. ""Today, we have capacities that can supply Germany for 30 to 60 minutes, but not for a prolonged dark doldrums,"" warns Schwarz. That means: power generation and power consumption must be identical every minute.

## The Federal Network Agency Calculates Differently

Until three years ago, Germany had the rule: the ""secured generating capacity"" must always be able to cover the maximum power demand. In other words: it must always be clear that there is enough power available, even in extreme cases. That's no longer the case. The Federal Network Agency, responsible for supply security, calls this calculation method outdated.

Instead, they now calculate the probability of such a case occurring. The result of the ""stress test"": on average, the complete power supply is not guaranteed for just 40 minutes a year. But even then, the lights in Germany won't simply go out: ""During this time, the majority of the load can be covered, only a very small part may not be served by the market,"" emphasizes the Federal Network Agency.

## Agency Relies on Multiple Emergency Mechanisms

The ""very small part"" refers to a few large industrial plants that would be temporarily disconnected from the grid - such as aluminum smelters. These major consumers have agreements in place to reduce their power consumption in emergency situations. With these mechanisms, the Federal Network Agency is confident that the power supply can be maintained even in extreme cases.";2022

Moscow. December 14. INTERFAX.RU - The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reported that cases of the ""Omicron"" strain have been detected in 77 countries.

![In the UK, the first person infected with the ""Omicron"" strain has died](https://www.interfax.ru/ftproot/textphotos/2021/12/13/UK_240.jpg)

""Omicron may have already entered most countries where it has not yet been detected,"" Ghebreyesus said at a briefing on Tuesday.

He added that despite the fact that there are few severe cases of ""Omicron"" infection, the number of cases is growing rapidly, which could lead to overcrowding in hospitals.

The ""Omicron"" strain was first detected in southern Africa in November. Experts believe that it may pose a threat because it spreads much faster than other strains that have been detected during the pandemic and contains a large number of mutations.

# Europe wants to make building materials more sustainable

April 10, 2024

![Europe wants to make building materials more sustainable](https://assets.nationbuilder.com/groen/pages/18656/attachments/original/1712762311/Persbericht_zonder_foto_parlementslid_%2810%29.png?1712762311)

""To accelerate the use of sustainable and safe building products, this law sets a higher standard for our product standards. A good thing that leads to a climate and environmental policy that protects both humans and the planet, and provides a level playing field for our businesses.""

**The European Parliament has just voted on a law to make building products more sustainable and improve reuse. The impact of the construction sector on the climate and environment is enormous. That's why the law is, according to [Sara Matthieu](/sara-matthieu), who was the rapporteur in the Environment Committee, an essential building block of the European Green Deal: ""To accelerate the use of sustainable and safe building products, this law sets a higher standard for our product standards. A good thing that leads to a climate and environmental policy that protects both humans and the planet, and provides a level playing field for our businesses.""**

**Only 1% of building materials are reused**

The impact of the construction sector is enormous. It is responsible for half of all raw materials used in Europe, produces 35% of all waste in the EU, and consumes a third of the total European water consumption. The construction sector is responsible for 36% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. That's more than the total emissions of the African continent. Matthieu: ""Intervening in the sector can bring us many environmental and climate benefits. Moreover, only 1% of all building products are reused, partly due to a lack of standards and product norms that facilitate dismantling and reuse. That needs to change urgently, and with this law, we are taking an important step. We are stimulating the growth of innovative companies in the sector.""

**Steps forward**

We are making progress in terms of sustainability. For the first time, the law prescribes a specific approach to the environmental impact of products through new product standards. Matthieu: ""Manufacturers will have to disclose the impact of their building products, such as insulation materials, roofing and flooring, or doors and windows, ranging from climate to toxicity for humans and nature. This information will also be made available through a digital product passport. This makes it easier for companies, and where relevant also for consumers, to compare different materials.""

**Repair instead of replace**

We are also giving the European Commission the possibility to require manufacturers to provide spare parts at an affordable price and a reasonable delivery time, for example for window frames.";2024

# Two thirds of Poles oppose adoption of the euro, poll shows

Share

According to a survey released over the Easter weekend an overwhelming majority of Poles oppose entry into the common-currency Eurozone, preferring to keep the Polish złoty.

A poll conducted by the United Surveysagency for news portal *Wirtualna Polska* (*WP*)found that 67 per cent of respondents were against any attempt to replace the złoty with the euro, with 27 per cent backing the idea.

Adoption of the common currency was opposed by 52 per cent of voters who, at the last elections, supported parties that now form the Government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Just 37 per cent of pro-Government voters were willing to consider ditching the złoty.

[![]()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=earrcf0O9Ls&t=7s)

The strongest opposition to the introduction of the euro was from voters who backed the Conservatives (PiS) or the right-wing Confederation party at the last elections, with 95 per cent against adopting the common currency.

The parties that make up the ruling coalition – the Civic Coalition led by Tusk, the Third Way alliance and the Left party – are in favour signing up for the common currency but have indicated there would be no such move any time soon.

Finance minister Andrzej Domański stated in March that Poland has not, as yet, met the criteria for joining the ERM II mechanism pegging the złoty to the euro for a period before the European bloc’s currency is officially adopted.

Both the PiS and Confederation are opposed to Poland adopting the euro, citing what they said were negative experiences for southern Europe and price rises in neighbouring Baltic states and Slovakia.

The governor of Poland’s central bank (NBP) Adam Glapiński has said he would not support any such move until the Polish GDP per head was around that of Germany’s. He is currently facing an attempt to oust him by the Tusk Government over an alleged failure to control inflation.

Membership of ERM II requires Glapiński and Domański to apply to the European Central Bank, proposing a fixed rate of the złoty to the euro, requiring the Polish central bank to maintain that set value with only 15 per cent variations either way.

(PiS) MP Zbigniew Kuzmiuk told *Brussels Signal*: “The attempt to oust Glapiński has been caused by his staunch opposition to making any moves towards adoption of the euro, which he is capable of blocking as joining the ERM II mechanism is not possible without consent of a country’s central bank.”

The PiS also pointed to the fact that the Polish Constitution would need to be changed for the złoty to be replaced by the euro and to do that a two-thirds majority in favour in Parliament would have to be secured.

Poland joining the ERM II mechanism would be possible as long as the head of the central bank consented.

Adopting the European common currency was part of Poland’s European Union accession treaty, although no deadline for doing so was agreed.

The previous Tusk-led government (2007-2015) considered such a move but backed out amid the financial crisis of 2008. The then-finance minister Jacek Rostowski persuaded Tusk that Poland retaining the złoty was a useful tool enabling devaluation to avoid a deep recession.

Poland’s political parties are currently occupied by elections at the regional, municipal and county levels on April 7. Campaigning for the European Parliament elections in June is yet to begin.

The fact that Poles continue to oppose adopting the euro will likely become a focus of the PiS campaign in the European elections, while it will probably be an issue the ruling coalition would prefer to side-step.

# Mostly True: Inflation issue that most concerns Portuguese in 2024 EU elections

**The [March 2024 IPSOS poll exclusively for Euronews](https://pt.euronews.com/2024/03/25/sondagem-euronews-inflacao-e-a-grande-preocupacao-dos-europeus-portugueses-sao-os-mais-ala) reveals that fighting inflation is the top priority for Portuguese citizens. However, Portuguese voters are also concerned about social inequalities and economic growth, with little difference between the three issues.**

In fact, in March 2024, less than three months before the European elections, 84% of Portuguese voters were more concerned about rising prices. In turn, 14% considered the fight against inflation to be important, but not a priority, in contrast to the 2% who believed it to be merely a secondary issue.

![](https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/euronews2.png)

The IPSOS poll for Euronews, carried out in 18 European countries in the run-up to the elections, seeks to find out the main priorities of European citizens in these European elections: fighting inflation; reducing social inequalities and preserving social protection systems; economic growth; illegal immigration; fighting unemployment; and climate change. In Portugal, the sample is made up of 2,000 people.

With regard to the fight against social inequalities, 82% of the Portuguese point to this issue as another top priority. However, 82% of voters also consider a Europe-wide intervention necessary to stimulate Portugal’s economic growth.

The differences lie in the other categories. 15% of Portuguese respondents consider the fight against social inequalities to be important, but not a priority, and 3% somewhat secondary. With regard to economic growth, 17% said it was important, but not a priority, and 1% said it was secondary.

#### **Inflation is also the top priority for European citizens**

According to the same survey, as in Portugal, [inflation is the issue](https://pt.euronews.com/2024/03/25/sondagem-euronews-inflacao-e-a-grande-preocupacao-dos-europeus-portugueses-sao-os-mais-ala) that most worries the rest of Europe’s citizens. In fact, more than two thirds of those surveyed (68%) are concerned about the rise in the cost of living due to the inflationary crisis of 2023, felt above all in the rise in food prices.

![](https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/euronews5.png)

In second place, 64% of voters demand a reduction in social inequalities and the preservation of social protection systems. In third place in the table is concern about economic growth. The fourth priority is the fight against illegal immigration (59%), which reflects the growth of the far right in Europe. In fifth place is the fight against unemployment (57%) and, finally, the response to climate change (52%).

#### **A previous study also indicated the economic crisis as the Portuguese’s biggest concern**

Political scientists Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, who conducted [a study based on a January 2024 European Council on Foreign Relations](https://ecfr.eu/publication/a-crisis-of-ones-own-the-politics-of-trauma-in-europes-election-year/) (ECFR) poll in 11 European countries, including Portugal, suggested that European voters are divided into five “crisis tribes” that correspond to the five biggest concerns: climate change, global economic turmoil, immigration, the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

""It's not excluded,"" Von der Leyen said during the first debate before the European elections, when asked if, in the event of her re-election, she would ban TikTok in the EU due to its ties with China, as the United States is considering.

The European Commission was the ""first institution in the world"" to ban the installation of TikTok on corporate phones, and it is well aware of the ""TikTok danger,"" the EPP candidate emphasized.

She also highlighted that, under her leadership, the European executive has ""done a lot"" to regulate services to ensure that platforms are responsible for the content they provide, as well as digital markets, to ensure that large companies do not act as gatekeepers and to provide fair access to them.

Von der Leyen made these statements just a week before meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Paris as part of the European tour that the Chinese leader will undertake next week. The tour will include visits to France, Hungary, and Serbia, and will be Xi's first trip to Europe in the past five years.

The possibility of banning the social network in the United States has also been raised during the visit of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to Beijing, after the US Senate approved a bill that would require the Chinese company ByteDance, which created TikTok, to sell the popular video app or face a ban in the US.

The article also mentions other news stories, including one about a lawyer who claims to have caught the father of Radu Miruță in an offside position, and another about a user who defends Nicușor Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, using profane language. Additionally, it is reported that TikTok has suspended its Lite program in Spain and France after the European Commission warned that the new app was launched without a prior report being published.";2024

![Last twelve months warmer than ever measured](https://redactie.rtl.nl/sites/default/files/content/images/2022/01/14/klimaatverandering%20afghanistan.jpg?itok=m5tECPBG&offsetX=0&offsetY=94&cropWidth=1024&cropHeight=576&width=1024&height=576&impolicy=dynamic)

They conducted this research in the run-up to a new global climate summit, which begins at the end of this month in Dubai. It is known that the current climate policy of all countries combined is insufficient to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Climate Agreement.

Earlier this year, there were already reports of record temperatures being measured in individual months. The researchers warn that temperatures will continue to rise and the weather will become more extreme until world leaders ensure that greenhouse gas emissions decrease.

## **Extreme heatwaves**

In the analysis, the researchers looked at various locations around the world to see how great the impact of climate change is on temperature. One in four people worldwide (1.9 billion people) experienced extreme heatwaves during that period. This heat is often accompanied by severe air pollution.

During the year, 90% of all people (7.3 billion) experienced a period of at least ten hot days that had become more extreme due to climate change.

#### Summer of 2023 is the warmest ever measured worldwide

## El Niño

The weather phenomenon El Niño and the reduction of emissions from shipping, which made the air cleaner but also more intense solar radiation, played a small role. A much larger factor is the burning of fossil fuels.

Researcher Friederike Otto says: ""In the 1.3-degree warming, only a small part is natural variability. The largest part is due to greenhouse gas emissions.""

## Situation in the Netherlands

The situation in the Netherlands was not particularly notable over the past twelve months. ""Actually, the Netherlands dodged the bullet during that period,"" says Bart Verheggen of the KNMI. But according to him, the research clearly shows that people all over the world are now living in a different climate than 150 years ago. ""Especially the extremes stand out, and it's precisely those that have a significant impact on people's lives.""

#### No more ice on the North Pole in the summer sooner than expected

In the report, the researchers point out various weather extremes. For example, large parts of South America were much warmer than average during the first half of the past year. In the United States, more than 380 people died in over 20 different weather extremes, and the damage totaled nearly $70 billion.

Canada and Hawaii were hit by large wildfires. In Hawaii, 93 people lost their lives. There were also consequences in the EU. For example, a part of Spain experienced the driest period in 500 years. Extreme weather in Africa claimed the lives of 15,700 people.

# The number of supporters of complete confiscation of Russian assets in the European Parliament has increased, - DW

[Yuriy Kobzar](https://www.unian.ua/editor/yuriy-kobzar)

However, so far, the EU is only ready to transfer to Ukraine the bank interest accrued on these assets.

![Members of the European Parliament are gradually leaning towards the need to transfer Russian assets to Ukraine / REUTERS](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw== ""Members of the European Parliament are gradually leaning towards the need to transfer Russian assets to Ukraine / REUTERS"")

In the European Parliament, there is an increasing number of supporters of the idea of final [confiscation and transfer to Ukraine of frozen Russian assets](https://www.unian.ua/economics/finance/zamorozheni-aktivi-rf-yaki-krajini-naybilshe-boyatsya-konfiskaciji-12560037.html). This is reported by [DW](https://www.dw.com/uk/zmusiti-rf-platiti-dedali-bilse-evrodeputativ-za-konfiskaciu-aktiviv/a-68905106?maca=ukr-rss-ukr-all-1496-rdf).

The day before, a debate was held in the European Parliament on the use of frozen assets of the Russian Central Bank ""to support the victory and recovery of Ukraine"". As the publication notes, the ""overwhelming majority of deputies"" during this discussion supported the proposal of the European Commission to transfer bank profits from these assets to military aid to Ukraine.

However, this refers specifically to the accrued interest on those Russian deposits that are stored in Europe. ""Many parliamentarians insist that this is not enough. They cited various arguments in favor of confiscating the entire amount of Russian assets to support Ukraine – approximately 300 billion euros, of which about 220 billion are in the European Union,"" DW writes.

The European Parliament's special rapporteur on Russia, Andrius Kubilius, emphasized that such confiscation would be entirely legitimate, as international law and UN recommendations give states the right to apply countermeasures to force an aggressor to fulfill its legal obligations.

Kubilius recalled that the United States had resorted to such actions with state funds of Iran in 1981 and Iraq in 1992 to compensate for the damage caused to Kuwait. And now, after approval by Congress, the US administration will apply this mechanism to confiscate $20 billion in Russian assets frozen in the United States.

However, the pro-Russian lobby in the European Parliament insists that such confiscation is allegedly ""piracy"". In particular, this was stated by ""independent"" deputy from Slovakia Katarína Roth-Nevěďalová and two Irish parliamentarians from the Left Party, who usually take a pro-Russian position.

Closing the debate, the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, assured that for now, the European Union is not going to confiscate the frozen assets of the Russian Central Bank, ""because there is not enough clarity about what we can and cannot do"". ""Of course, we would be very happy if we could take these 300 billion euros,"" Borrell said. ""We will continue to study this issue and seek legal assistance to understand what else is possible.""

As UNIAN wrote, the US Congress [passed a bill](https://www.unian.ua/world/palata-predstavnikiv-shvalila-zakonoproyekt-pro-konfiskaciyu-rosiyskih-aktiviv-dlya-ukrajini-12611454.html) on the use of Russian assets frozen in American jurisdiction for the benefit of Ukraine.

![Highway](/sites/default/files/styles/image/public/2024-04/20240403_tempolimit-beitrag_1.png?itok=x7oLMK58)

## What We Free Democrats Stand For:

Instead of relying on bans, we focus on innovations and technological openness. We, the Free Democrats, strongly oppose a general speed limit on highways. For safe and climate-friendly mobility that is also affordable, we don't need a speed limit or a ban on internal combustion engines, but rather a well-maintained infrastructure network and intelligent traffic management. To reduce emissions, we rely on international emissions trading and innovative technologies such as intelligent guidance systems that help drivers avoid traffic jams and detours. This approach prevents congested traffic, which increases the risk of accidents and CO2 emissions.

## But Doesn't a Speed Limit Make Highways Safer and Help Reduce CO2 Emissions?

No, neither statement is entirely accurate. Highways in Germany are among the safest roads. We have a greater safety problem on rural roads. Moreover, there is no correlation between a general speed limit and increased safety on highways, even in international comparisons. Additionally, monotonous driving at a constant speed over long distances contributes to a higher risk of accidents. We must support innovative technologies and their development, which improve the safety of mobility. Guidance systems can also reduce traffic congestion and make it safer. Besides traffic safety, it is often claimed that speed limits have a positive impact on climate protection. A study commissioned by the FDP parliamentary group shows that a speed limit would only save 1.1 million tons of CO2 – at high economic costs. Instead of using inefficient symbolic measures and bans to protect the climate, we Free Democrats focus on innovations and new technologies for smooth and congestion-free traffic.

## Why We Support Emissions Trading:

To effectively combat climate change, we rely on the opportunities offered by modern technologies. Our goal must be to establish an international emissions trading system as quickly as possible. To achieve this, the global climate club must be expanded and supplemented by an agreement on a unified emissions trading system. Driven by economic incentives, emissions trading promotes innovative technologies, such as the use of climate-friendly engines and fuels.

**03 Executive Summary**

Although the effects of demographic change on social insurance have been barely noticeable so far, the end of the grace period is approaching. The shortage of skilled workers on the labor market is becoming increasingly severe, and the political discussion about measures to attract migrants is gaining momentum. The question arises as to whether labor migration can actually relieve the public households in the future. Against this background, this publication analyzes the fiscal effects of migration based on the updated generational accounting for 2023.

To determine the fiscal balance, the current average per-capita payments of foreigners living in the country are used for future migrants, and an integration period of six years is assumed. In particular, the assumed six-year integration period leads to lower net payments by future migrants compared to the native population, resulting in a significant increase in the sustainability gap from 447.8 to 497.1 percent of GDP. In a hypothetical scenario without any future migration flows, the sustainability gap would be 347.4 percent of GDP, which is 149.7 percentage points lower. The fiscal balance of future immigration is therefore negative and amounts to almost one and a half times the current annual economic performance, assuming 293,000 immigrants per year. However, the remaining high sustainability gap in the hypothetical case without migration shows that the actual problems are less due to migration and more due to an overly generous (social) state that lives beyond its means in the long term.

One option for reducing the financial burden of migration is to implement migration policy measures that aim to improve the qualification structure of future migrants. Under optimistic assumptions, these measures could be designed to ensure that half of the migrants have a vocational training or a university degree, which would reduce the sustainability gap by 64 percentage points.

Another possibility for reducing the financial burden of migration is to implement migration policy measures that promote additional labor migration. In contrast to the annual net migration of 293,000 people in the reference scenario, this scenario assumes additional immigration, which... (the text is cut off here)";2025

## Jan van Aken against armament policy: ""The Left's position doesn't change""

In the Ukraine war, the Left Party leader demands more EU diplomacy. He thinks it's wrong for the old Bundestag to change the constitution quickly.

Interview by

**taz: Mr. van Aken, do you still have hope that in Ukraine, the law of the stronger won't triumph over international law?**

**Jan van Aken:** That's difficult. It's looking increasingly bleak. Ukraine has its back against the wall. It's infamous how Donald Trump wants to blame Ukraine for the war and stir up fear of a third world war to trample international law. The aggressor is clearly Russia. The big problem is that three years have passed since the war began, and the EU hasn't done anything substantial to promote negotiations. If they don't do it now, it looks really bad for Ukraine and international law.

Born in 1961, he is a biologist with a Ph.D. and worked as a biological weapons inspector for the UN from 2004 to 2006. Since October 2024, he has been the co-leader of the Left Party, along with Ines Schwerdtner.

**taz: Can it be that the Left Party is just as helpless in the face of the Ukraine war as the other democratic parties in the Bundestag?**

**Van Aken:** I wouldn't say ""just as helpless."" I think we've made some good suggestions that haven't even been discussed yet. We all know that there's no easy solution, but we need to try to find one. We need to support Ukraine, but we also need to promote diplomacy and negotiations. The EU needs to take a more active role in this. We can't just sit back and wait for the United States to take the lead. We need to take responsibility for our own foreign policy and work towards a peaceful solution.";2025

Your Excellencies,  
ladies and gentlemen,  
  
For the first time since the Paris Climate Agreement, we are taking stock here in Dubai. So, where do we stand as a global community?  
  
It is still possible for us to reduce emissions in this decade to the extent that we can meet the 1.5-degree target. But science tells us very clearly: we must hurry up - despite all geopolitical tensions. Because climate change remains the great, global challenge of our time.  
  
We have all the necessary means to meet these challenges. The technologies are available: wind power, photovoltaics, electric drives, green hydrogen. In 2022, more gigawatts of renewable energy were connected to the grid than ever before. $1.3 trillion was invested worldwide in clean energy and technologies - more money for climate protection than ever before. The demand for fossil fuels has slowed down. The peak is in sight.  
  
Germany is driving these developments forward with emphasis. As a successful industrial nation, we want to live and work in a climate-neutral way by 2045. In the European Union and in Germany, we have therefore ensured less bureaucracy and more speed in the expansion of renewable energies. In this way, we have increased the share of renewable energies in the power supply to a new record high - from 45 percent three years ago to almost 60 percent today. And Germany is gaining further momentum.  
  
But we also want to contribute to more speed in climate protection worldwide and make the energy transition a global success story. We must now all show the firm determination to get out of fossil fuels, first and foremost coal. For this, we";2025

### FIFA President reflects on “unique” and “perfect” FIFA World Cup 2022™ in Qatar

**Gianni Infantino hails “huge success” of 2022 tournament on and off the pitch**

**First FIFA World Cup™ in an Arab nation “part of making football truly global”**

**FIFA President says it was “definitely a catalyst for positive change in the country”**

Gianni Infantino attended all 64 matches of the FIFA World Cup 2022™, and one year on from Argentina captain Lionel Messi lifting the trophy after an epic final with France in Qatar, the FIFA President said he still gets “emotional” when looking back at “the best World Cup ever”.

**FIFA.com: Which words best describe your overall memories of the FIFA World Cup™ in Qatar 2022?
Gianni Infantino:** Well, the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ was, simply, the best [FIFA] World Cup ever. Happiness, joy, pride, fulfilment; everything that one can dream of when he thinks about the maximum that football can offer to the world happened in Qatar in 2022. And this particular [FIFA] World Cup, we had five billion viewers from home, we had three-and-a-half million, almost, spectators in the stadiums. One-and-a-half million came from all over the world in a joyful atmosphere. We had incredible matches, we had excitement, we had passion, we had heartbeat, we had joy, we had tears, we had emotion; we had everything.

**The tournament gave you a unique opportunity as well, didn’t it?**It was a unique [FIFA] World Cup, as well, in the sense that its compact nature allowed me to attend all 64 games. This is definitely a unique achievement in history. But many fans could attend, also, multiple games every day. Everything was close; the players could go back to their hotels, their headquarters, immediately after the game without having to fly somewhere. So, also, from a player’s perspective, it was extremely positive. The weather was perfect, the pitches were perfect, the stadiums were beautiful; everything was fantastic.   

FIFA President reflects on FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™

18 Dec 2023

**On and off the pitch, as you said, it was a unique tournament. What made this one so special?**Well, obviously, most importantly for most of the fans around the world it’s what happens on the pitch and, on the pitch, it was a unique [FIFA] World Cup as well: 172 goals, a record number of goals scored in a FIFA World Cup final tournament. We had three Asian teams, for example, proceeding to the next round. We had an African team for the first time in history in the semi-final, with Morocco. We had excitement, we had surprises, we had heartbeat. And we had, certainly, the best final ever. Thrilling, entertaining, goals here and there, extra time, penalty kicks; I mean, everything. Epic!

Off the pitch, as well, it was an incredible success. We had no incidents whatsoever, we had a joyful atmosphere. We had two million people in the Fan Zone, in the Fan Festival of FIFA. We had fans coming from all over the world and enjoying football. We had eight state-of-the-art stadiums, from Al Bayt, where the opening [ceremony] took place, to Lusail, where the final took place; all eight stadiums were absolutely stunning, fantastic. Over 53,000 spectators per match. Attendance going in, going out of the stadiums, everything ran smoothly.
