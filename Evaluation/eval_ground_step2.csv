# Russia abandons International Space Station: It could fall on Europe!

They say the partnership will only be restored when sanctions are lifted

![Russia abandons International Space Station: It could fall on Europe!](https://phantom.estaticos-marca.com/149e4bc43e9009d5e618c337ffb98dee/resize/1320/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2022/04/03/16490008307804.png)

**Russia** has ended its cooperation with **Western countries** regarding the **International Space Station**, with the country's space director stating on Saturday that the ties would only be restored in the event that the sanctions imposed by the **West** on **Moscow** are lifted.

**Dmitry Rogozin**, the head of **Roscosmos**, said in a social media post that the aim of the sanctions was ""to kill the Russian economy and plunge our people into despair and hunger, to bring our country to its knees."" He added that ""they will not succeed, but the intentions are clear.""

""That is why I believe that the restoration of normal relations between the partners of the **International Space Station (ISS)** and other projects is only possible with the full and unconditional removal of the illegal sanctions imposed,"" **Rogozin** said.

## International Space Station could plunge towards Earth

The **West** has introduced wide-ranging sanctions against **Russia** for what **Moscow** calls a ""special military operation"" in **Ukraine**, which was launched on February 24. Despite the tensions, a [**US astronaut**](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/03/15/622fc081e2704e25918b458d.html) and two **Russian cosmonauts** landed safely in Kazakhstan last Wednesday after leaving the space station aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule.

The end of cooperation will mean, **Rogozin** said, a serious risk of an uncontrolled departure of the station from its orbit and a possible fall onto the territory of the **United States**, **Europe** or other countries.

""There is a possibility that this 500-tonne structure could fall over **Europe** and also over **India** and **China**. The **ISS** does not fly over **Russia**, so all the risks are theirs. Are they prepared for that?"" the **Roscosmos** chief warned.

# Anti-Semitism New Danger from Old Myths

Status: February 14, 2022, 15:21

**A global conspiracy is Corona, the goal is a totalitarian dictatorship or even genocide: Such conspiracy legends are a new packaging for old anti-Semitic myths.**

![Patrick Gensing](https://images.tagesschau.de/image/d8f53546-1758-4e65-9a46-35927c2dd7d6/AAABkwYM1PE/AAABmyZFCYU/1x1-small/patrick-gensing-103.jpg?width=144)

*By Patrick Gensing, ARD fact-checking editorial team*

Conspiracy myths and downplaying of National Socialism have become more publicly visible in Germany during the Corona pandemic. Just last week, a speaker at the Brandenburg Gate, near the Holocaust Memorial, compared himself to Jews in the 1930s.

About two weeks earlier, activists in Berlin had shown posters with ""Total Hygiene"" and ""Total Vaccination"" written in Fraktur script, reminiscent of swastika flags, apparently trying to equate the measures against the pandemic with the terror of the National Socialist dictatorship.

The posters had already been shown at ""lateral thinker"" protests in early October. At that time, activists also showed a logo for a ""democratic resistance."" The motif of the ""People's Constitutional Convention"" contains the red triangle of the political prisoners of the National Socialist concentration camps.

## ""Outrageous""

These are just a few examples from recent months. But what is anti-Semitic about such statements and representations?

On the one hand, they downplay the crimes of the National Socialist dictatorship. When people hold speeches at registered demonstrations and spread them on the internet, exercising their fundamental right to freedom of assembly and expression, comparing it to the totalitarian National Socialist regime is completely inappropriate - and often unbearable for people who were actually exposed to this political terror.

Maram Stern, Vice President of the World Jewish Congress, called it ""particularly repulsive"" when so-called Corona deniers tried to claim a victim role for themselves that is equivalent to that of the Holocaust victims. ""I don't know what could be more outrageous than seizing the history of suffering of the high-aged survivors of Auschwitz, Majdanek, and thousands of other concentration camps and ghettos. It is the epitome of empathylessness, blindness, and cynicism.""

###### Belgrade

**BELGRADE, Serbia**

Croatia's president said the genocides in Srebrenica and Jasenovac are not the same because Jews and Serbs were systematically killed for several years in the Ustase-run concentration camp in Jasenovac, Croatia during World War II.

Zoran Milanovic said that worse events took place in history, and a new name other than “genocide” should be found for the Srebrenica events.

""Srebrenica is not the same as the Holocaust, it is not the same as Jasenovac,'' Milanovic said, speaking to the press in the city of Komija on the Croatian island of Vis.

""I say yes, but then for some more serious crimes, we have to invent another name. I respect other people's sacrifices, but not everything is the same. If everything is genocide, we will have to find another name for what the Nazis and the German machinery did to the Jews in the Second World War. It is the Holocaust, but it is also genocide. Not every victim is the same, it is relativization,'' he said, answering a question on whether he considered Srebrenica a genocide.

The social democrat took the presidency in Croatia with the election in 2020.

The chairman of the Bosniak Ethnic Minority Council in Croatia, Armin Hodzic, said at a press conference that Milanovic has crossed the line of civilization that no one should cross with his statements about the Srebrenica genocide.

""Milanovic has an innate prejudice against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bosnians,” said Hodzic.

Established in 1941, the Jasenovac camp saw an estimated 100,000 Serbs, Jews, Roma and others murdered by the Ustase regime of Croatian fascist leader Ante Pavelic.

During World War II, the Nazis carried out a genocide against the Jews. Most of the Jews in the countries occupied by Nazi Germany were sent to concentration camps. About 6 million Jews died on trains and in the camps.

Moscow. December 14. INTERFAX.RU - The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reported that cases of the ""Omicron"" strain have been detected in 77 countries.

![In the UK, the first person infected with the ""Omicron"" strain has died](https://www.interfax.ru/ftproot/textphotos/2021/12/13/UK_240.jpg)

""Omicron may have already entered most countries where it has not yet been detected,"" Ghebreyesus said at a briefing on Tuesday.

He added that despite the fact that there are few severe cases of ""Omicron"" infection, the number of cases is growing rapidly, which could lead to overcrowding in hospitals.

The ""Omicron"" strain was first detected in southern Africa in November. Experts believe that it may pose a threat because it spreads much faster than other strains that have been detected during the pandemic and contains a large number of mutations.

**Cost increases associated with the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mean flights will become more expensive and demand will be hit, UK industry group Sustainable Aviation has said.**

In its Net Zero Carbon Road-Map, the aviation collective, which counts UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and air navigation service providers as members, also said the UK risked losing a potential of 60,000 jobs and its position as a global leader in air travel sustainability without more government support. 

In its updated strategy document, it confirmed that UK aviation can continue to grow while meeting its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The launch of the report coincides with the Sustainable Skies World Summit, taking place this week in Farnborough, UK.

In addition to celebrating the UK’s pioneering role in the development of SAF (*at least eight producers are planning plants in the country, in addition to the active Philipps 66 site on the Humber*), the report praises advances in airspace modernisation.

Yet it points to the “reality” that the increased cost of decarbonising aviation will “inevitably reduce passenger demand”.

“The demand reduction due to the costs of decarbonisation represents around 14 percent of the industry’s reduction in CO2 emissions,” Sustainable Aviation said in a statement. 

“However, this modelling also shows that, even with slightly higher costs, people still want to fly, with overall growth in passenger numbers of almost 250 million by 2050.”

In his opening address in the report, Matt Gorman, Chair, Sustainable Aviation, said: “Increased costs for industry and consumers could have some impact on future demand for air travel, but our work shows that significant ongoing growth can be achieved at the same time as decarbonising aviation.” 

Sustainable Aviation estimates that 9.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) could be saved due to the decarbonisation cost impact on demand.

Other measures which will contribute to meeting the net-zero carbon commitment include fleet upgrades and direct and direct air capture methods. 

The full Net Zero Carbon Road-Map can be found on Sustainable Aviation’s website.

**The projected pathway to net-zero carbon for the UK’s aviation industry.**

**The projected pathway to net-zero carbon for the UK’s aviation industry.**

“This is the critical decade where aviation must prove it will decarbonise,” Gorman said in a statement.

“Our updated Net Zero Carbon Road Map shows that we have a clear, credible path to take the carbon out of flying. Through a combination of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, more efficient aircraft and airspace, zero emission planes and carbon removals, we can protect the huge benefits of aviation for future generations without the carbon cost.”

Shai Weiss, CEO, Virgin Atlantic, added: “This Road-Map highlights the critical role that Sustainable Aviation Fuel will need to play in decarbonising UK aviation.

# Two thirds of Poles oppose adoption of the euro, poll shows

Share

According to a survey released over the Easter weekend an overwhelming majority of Poles oppose entry into the common-currency Eurozone, preferring to keep the Polish złoty.

A poll conducted by the United Surveysagency for news portal *Wirtualna Polska* (*WP*)found that 67 per cent of respondents were against any attempt to replace the złoty with the euro, with 27 per cent backing the idea.

Adoption of the common currency was opposed by 52 per cent of voters who, at the last elections, supported parties that now form the Government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Just 37 per cent of pro-Government voters were willing to consider ditching the złoty.

[![]()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=earrcf0O9Ls&t=7s)

The strongest opposition to the introduction of the euro was from voters who backed the Conservatives (PiS) or the right-wing Confederation party at the last elections, with 95 per cent against adopting the common currency.

The parties that make up the ruling coalition – the Civic Coalition led by Tusk, the Third Way alliance and the Left party – are in favour signing up for the common currency but have indicated there would be no such move any time soon.

Finance minister Andrzej Domański stated in March that Poland has not, as yet, met the criteria for joining the ERM II mechanism pegging the złoty to the euro for a period before the European bloc’s currency is officially adopted.

Both the PiS and Confederation are opposed to Poland adopting the euro, citing what they said were negative experiences for southern Europe and price rises in neighbouring Baltic states and Slovakia.

The governor of Poland’s central bank (NBP) Adam Glapiński has said he would not support any such move until the Polish GDP per head was around that of Germany’s. He is currently facing an attempt to oust him by the Tusk Government over an alleged failure to control inflation.

Membership of ERM II requires Glapiński and Domański to apply to the European Central Bank, proposing a fixed rate of the złoty to the euro, requiring the Polish central bank to maintain that set value with only 15 per cent variations either way.

(PiS) MP Zbigniew Kuzmiuk told *Brussels Signal*: “The attempt to oust Glapiński has been caused by his staunch opposition to making any moves towards adoption of the euro, which he is capable of blocking as joining the ERM II mechanism is not possible without consent of a country’s central bank.”

The PiS also pointed to the fact that the Polish Constitution would need to be changed for the złoty to be replaced by the euro and to do that a two-thirds majority in favour in Parliament would have to be secured.

Poland joining the ERM II mechanism would be possible as long as the head of the central bank consented.

Adopting the European common currency was part of Poland’s European Union accession treaty, although no deadline for doing so was agreed.

The previous Tusk-led government (2007-2015) considered such a move but backed out amid the financial crisis of 2008. The then-finance minister Jacek Rostowski persuaded Tusk that Poland retaining the złoty was a useful tool enabling devaluation to avoid a deep recession.

Poland’s political parties are currently occupied by elections at the regional, municipal and county levels on April 7. Campaigning for the European Parliament elections in June is yet to begin.

The fact that Poles continue to oppose adopting the euro will likely become a focus of the PiS campaign in the European elections, while it will probably be an issue the ruling coalition would prefer to side-step.

# Mostly True: Inflation issue that most concerns Portuguese in 2024 EU elections

**The [March 2024 IPSOS poll exclusively for Euronews](https://pt.euronews.com/2024/03/25/sondagem-euronews-inflacao-e-a-grande-preocupacao-dos-europeus-portugueses-sao-os-mais-ala) reveals that fighting inflation is the top priority for Portuguese citizens. However, Portuguese voters are also concerned about social inequalities and economic growth, with little difference between the three issues.**

In fact, in March 2024, less than three months before the European elections, 84% of Portuguese voters were more concerned about rising prices. In turn, 14% considered the fight against inflation to be important, but not a priority, in contrast to the 2% who believed it to be merely a secondary issue.

![](https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/euronews2.png)

The IPSOS poll for Euronews, carried out in 18 European countries in the run-up to the elections, seeks to find out the main priorities of European citizens in these European elections: fighting inflation; reducing social inequalities and preserving social protection systems; economic growth; illegal immigration; fighting unemployment; and climate change. In Portugal, the sample is made up of 2,000 people.

With regard to the fight against social inequalities, 82% of the Portuguese point to this issue as another top priority. However, 82% of voters also consider a Europe-wide intervention necessary to stimulate Portugal’s economic growth.

The differences lie in the other categories. 15% of Portuguese respondents consider the fight against social inequalities to be important, but not a priority, and 3% somewhat secondary. With regard to economic growth, 17% said it was important, but not a priority, and 1% said it was secondary.

#### **Inflation is also the top priority for European citizens**

According to the same survey, as in Portugal, [inflation is the issue](https://pt.euronews.com/2024/03/25/sondagem-euronews-inflacao-e-a-grande-preocupacao-dos-europeus-portugueses-sao-os-mais-ala) that most worries the rest of Europe’s citizens. In fact, more than two thirds of those surveyed (68%) are concerned about the rise in the cost of living due to the inflationary crisis of 2023, felt above all in the rise in food prices.

![](https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/euronews5.png)

In second place, 64% of voters demand a reduction in social inequalities and the preservation of social protection systems. In third place in the table is concern about economic growth. The fourth priority is the fight against illegal immigration (59%), which reflects the growth of the far right in Europe. In fifth place is the fight against unemployment (57%) and, finally, the response to climate change (52%).

#### **A previous study also indicated the economic crisis as the Portuguese’s biggest concern**

Political scientists Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, who conducted [a study based on a January 2024 European Council on Foreign Relations](https://ecfr.eu/publication/a-crisis-of-ones-own-the-politics-of-trauma-in-europes-election-year/) (ECFR) poll in 11 European countries, including Portugal, suggested that European voters are divided into five “crisis tribes” that correspond to the five biggest concerns: climate change, global economic turmoil, immigration, the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

""It's not excluded,"" Von der Leyen said during the first debate before the European elections, when asked if, in the event of her re-election, she would ban TikTok in the EU due to its ties with China, as the United States is considering.

The European Commission was the ""first institution in the world"" to ban the installation of TikTok on corporate phones, and it is well aware of the ""TikTok danger,"" the EPP candidate emphasized.

She also highlighted that, under her leadership, the European executive has ""done a lot"" to regulate services to ensure that platforms are responsible for the content they provide, as well as digital markets, to ensure that large companies do not act as gatekeepers and to provide fair access to them.

Von der Leyen made these statements just a week before her meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Paris, as part of the European tour that the Chinese leader will undertake next week. The tour will include visits to France, Hungary, and Serbia, and will be Xi's first trip to Europe in the past five years.

The possibility of banning the social network in the United States has also been raised during the visit of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to Beijing, after the US Senate approved a bill that would require the Chinese company ByteDance, which created TikTok, to sell the popular video app or face a ban in the US.

# Last Twelve Months Warmer Than Ever Measured

![Last twelve months warmer than ever measured](https://redactie.rtl.nl/sites/default/files/content/images/2022/01/14/klimaatverandering%20afghanistan.jpg?itok=m5tECPBG&offsetX=0&offsetY=94&cropWidth=1024&cropHeight=576&width=1024&height=576&impolicy=dynamic)

They conducted this research in the run-up to a new global climate summit, which begins at the end of this month in Dubai. It is known that the current climate policy of all countries combined is insufficient to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Climate Agreement.

Earlier this year, there were already reports of record temperatures being measured in individual months. The researchers warn that temperatures will continue to rise and the weather will become more extreme until world leaders ensure that greenhouse gas emissions decrease.

## **Extreme Heatwaves**

In the analysis, the researchers looked at various locations around the world to see how great the impact of climate change is on temperature. One in four people worldwide (1.9 billion people) experienced extreme heatwaves during that period. This heat is often accompanied by severe air pollution.

During the year, 90% of all people (7.3 billion) experienced a period of at least ten hot days that had become more extreme due to climate change.

#### Summer of 2023 is the warmest ever measured worldwide

## El Niño

The weather phenomenon El Niño and the reduction of emissions from shipping, which made the air cleaner but also more intense sunlight, played a small role. A much larger factor is the burning of fossil fuels.

Researcher Friederike Otto says: ""In the 1.3-degree warming, only a small part is natural variability. The largest part is due to the emission of greenhouse gases.""

## Situation in the Netherlands

The situation in the Netherlands was not particularly notable over the past twelve months. ""Actually, the Netherlands dodged the bullet during that period,"" says Bart Verheggen of the KNMI. But according to him, the research clearly shows that people all over the world are now living in a different climate than 150 years ago. ""Especially the extremes stand out, and it's precisely those that have a significant impact on people's lives.""

#### Faster than expected, no more ice on the North Pole in the summer

In the report, the researchers point out various weather extremes. For example, large parts of South America were much warmer than average during the first half of last year. In the United States, more than 380 people died in over 20 different weather extremes, and the damage amounted to almost $70 billion.

Canada and Hawaii were hit by large wildfires. In Hawaii, 93 people lost their lives. There were also consequences in the EU. For example, in part of Spain, the driest period in 500 years occurred. Due to extreme weather in Africa, 15,700 people died.

## Game Abandonments in Amateur Football – DFB Cites Shocking Numbers

![](https://images.welt.de/67da0b29a7ec4b4b052eb508/cf5da8f857f1f29e8278313519a03149/ci16x9-w1000/dpa-5fae3800ab571799-jpg)

Violence and game abandonments are on the rise in German amateur football. This is the conclusion reached by both the German Football Association (DFB) and the Westphalia Football and Athletics Association.

Source: WELT

The German Football Association has presented its assessment of the amateur football situation. The numbers regarding violence and discrimination are alarming – stagnating at a high level. This is a cause for concern for the association's leaders, who are increasing their focus on preventive measures.

In the past season, 961 amateur football games were abandoned due to violence and discrimination. The DFB announced this on Monday when presenting its assessment. This is an unsatisfactory number, said DFB Vice President Ronny Zimmermann. ""We must intensify our efforts. We have stopped the trend, but the numbers are stagnating at a high level."" There are ""still too many victims. This is an image that football cannot live with.""

 Alone, 126 matches involving F-, E-, and D-youth teams (children aged six to twelve) were ended prematurely due to violence and discrimination. The abandonment rate remains unchanged at 0.08%, despite more games being played.

According to the DFB, there were 6,224 incidents on amateur pitches during the past season, which corresponds to 0.5% of all games with a completed match report. 4,116 players were named as suspects, 1,191 coaches were accused, and 2,200 spectators were involved.

### ""This must be a final warning signal""

Mostly, referees are overrepresented in the group of victims. This is because they are solely responsible for game management in the lower leagues.

After the death of a 15-year-old Berliner following a violent attack by an opponent during a youth tournament in Frankfurt am Main, Zimmermann will remember the past season as negative. ""Beyond all statistics, we must note that a person lost their life in the past season. This must be a final warning signal, regardless of the role one plays in sports,"" he said.

![Highway](/sites/default/files/styles/image/public/2024-04/20240403_speed_limit_contribution_1.png?itok=x7oLMK58)

## What We Free Democrats Stand For:

Instead of relying on bans, we focus on innovations and technological openness. We Free Democrats decisively reject a general speed limit on highways. For safe and climate-friendly mobility that is also affordable, we don't need a speed limit or a ban on internal combustion engines, but rather a well-maintained infrastructure network and intelligent traffic management. To reduce emissions, we Free Democrats rely on international emissions trading and innovative technologies such as intelligent guidance systems that help drivers avoid traffic jams and detours. This prevents congested traffic, which increases the risk of accidents and CO2 emissions.

## But Doesn't a Speed Limit Make Highways Safer and Help Save a Lot of CO2?

No, neither is true. Highways in Germany are among our safest roads. We have a safety problem on country roads instead. Internationally, there is no correlation between a general speed limit and a higher level of safety on highways. Additionally, monotonous driving at a constant speed over long distances contributes to an increased risk of accidents. We must support innovative technologies and their development, which improve the safety of mobility. Guidance systems can also make traffic more efficient and safer. Besides traffic safety, it is often claimed that speed limits have a positive impact on climate protection. A study commissioned by the FDP parliamentary group shows that a speed limit could only save 1.1 million tons of CO2 – at high economic costs. Instead of using inefficient symbolic measures and bans to protect the climate, we Free Democrats rely on innovations and new technologies for smooth and congestion-free traffic.

## Why We Support Emissions Trading?

To effectively combat climate change, we rely on the opportunities offered by modern technologies. The goal must be to establish an international emissions trading system as quickly as possible. To achieve this, the global climate club must be expanded and supplemented by an agreement on a unified emissions trading system. Driven by economic incentives, emissions trading promotes innovative technologies, such as the use of climate-friendly engines and fuels.

**Executive Summary**
Although the effects of demographic change on social insurance have been barely noticeable so far, the end of the grace period is approaching. The shortage of skilled workers on the labor market is becoming increasingly apparent, and the political discussion about measures to recruit migrants is gaining momentum. The question arises as to how labor migration can actually relieve public households in the future. Against this background, this publication analyzes the fiscal effects of migration based on the updated generational accounting for 2023.

To determine the fiscal balance, the current average per-capita payments of foreigners living in the country are used for future migrants, and an integration period of six years is assumed. In particular, the assumed six-year integration period leads to lower net payments by future migrants compared to the native population, resulting in a significant increase in the sustainability gap from 447.8 to 497.1 percent of GDP. In a hypothetical scenario without any future migration flows, the sustainability gap would be 347.4 percent of GDP, which is 149.7 percentage points lower. The fiscal balance of future immigration is therefore negative and amounts to almost one and a half times the current annual economic performance, assuming 293,000 immigrants per year. However, the remaining high sustainability gap in the hypothetical case without migration shows that the actual problems are less due to migration and more due to an overly generous (welfare) state that lives beyond its means in the long term.

One option to reduce the financial burden of migration is to implement migration policies that aim to improve the qualification structure of future migrants. Under optimistic assumptions, these could be selected such that half of them have a vocational training or a university degree, which would reduce the sustainability gap by 64 percentage points.

Another possibility to reduce the financial burden of migration is to implement migration policies that promote additional labor migration.

Your Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
  
For the first time since the Paris Climate Agreement, we are taking stock here in Dubai. So, where do we stand as a global community?  
  
It is still possible for us to reduce emissions in this decade to the extent that we meet the 1.5-degree target. But science tells us quite clearly: we must hurry up - despite all geopolitical tensions. Because climate change remains the great, global challenge of our time.  
  
We have all the necessary means to meet these challenges. The technologies are available: wind power, photovoltaics, electric drives, green hydrogen. In 2022, more gigawatts of renewable energy were connected to the grid than ever before. $1.3 billion was invested worldwide in clean energy and technologies - more money for climate protection than ever before. The demand for fossil energies has slowed down. The peak is in sight.  
  
Germany is driving these developments forward with emphasis. As a successful industrial nation, we want to live and work in a climate-neutral way by 2045. In the European Union and in Germany, we have therefore ensured less bureaucracy and more speed in the expansion of renewable energies. In this way, we have increased the share of renewable energies in the power supply to a new record high - from 45 percent three years ago to almost 60 percent today. And Germany is gaining further momentum.  
  
But we also want to contribute to more speed in climate protection worldwide and make the energy transition a global success story. We must now all show the firm determination to get out of fossil energy sources, first and foremost coal.

General Secretary Bijan Djir-Sarai (FDP): ""An instrument of central importance""

More than 800,000 people have been controlled at Germany's borders during the European Men's Football Championship. Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had reintroduced border controls within the EU for the duration of the tournament – and until July 19. According to FDP General Secretary Bijan Djir-Sarai, this should continue for a significantly longer period.

""Minister Faeser should quickly present a security concept on how border controls can be extended after the European Championship,"" Djir-Sarai told SPIEGEL. The permanent controls are ""a necessity to limit irregular migration to Germany,"" said the FDP member of parliament. ""As long as European external border protection does not work seamlessly, it is an instrument of central importance.""
