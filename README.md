## 🧭 Overview

**CheckMate** is a **research prototype multi-agent assistant** designed to support **journalism students** in learning and practicing **fact-checking**.

The system is grounded in the educational workflows developed by the **EUfactcheck project**  
(https://eufactcheck.eu), which were explicitly designed for **journalism education**.

Rather than merely automating fact-checking steps, CheckMate aims to:

- Teach **structured and transparent fact-checking workflows**
- Encourage **critical reasoning and reflection**

To achieve this, the assistant generates **critical, Socratic-style questions** at key stages of the workflow.  
These questions are intended to be discussed with peers in **oral or written reflective assignments**, encouraging students to reflect not only on *what* they conclude, but *why*.

Technically, CheckMate is implemented using the **LangGraph framework** and integrates a **FAISS vector store** for retrieval-augmented reasoning over fact-checking datasets.

## 📚 FACTors Dataset

Training and evaluation data were grounded in **real-world fact-checking claims** from the **FACTors project**, a large-scale dataset for studying the fact-checking ecosystem.

- FACTors GitHub repository:  
  👉 https://github.com/altuncu/FACTors

Synthetic training data was generated by transforming FACTors claims into **Socratic questions**, enabling the models to learn reflective, pedagogically oriented questioning behavior.
